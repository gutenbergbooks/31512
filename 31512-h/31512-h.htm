<p class='c fs14'>THE COMING OF THE LAW</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span><a id='link_1'></a>CHAPTER I<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE ARRIVAL OF THE MAN</span></h2>

<p>If the passengers on the west-bound train that pulled up at the little red
wooden station at Dry Bottom at the close of a June day in 18&#8211;, were
interested in the young man bearing the two suit cases, they gave no evidence of
it. True, they noted his departure; with casual glances they watched him as he
stepped down upon the platform; but immediately they forgot his athletic figure
and his regular featured, serious face as their thoughts returned to the heat,
the dust, and the monotony of travel.</p>

<p>There was the usual bustle and activity which always follows the arrival of a
train. A mail bag was dumped out of the mail car, another thrown in; some
express packages were unceremoniously deposited near the door of the station by
the agent; the conductor ran to the telegrapher&#8217;s <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span> window to receive an order; ran back,
signaling as he ran; the engine bell clanged, the drivers clanked, the wheels
ground, the passengers sighed, and the train departed on its way.</p>

<p>The young man who had alighted stood motionless for a moment, listening to
the clatter of the wheels over the rail-joints, watching the smoke from the
engine-stack befoul the clear blue of the sky. Then he smiled grimly, threw a
rapid glance toward a group of loungers standing at a corner of the station, and
walked over to where the station agent stood examining some newly arrived
packages.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mind directing me to the courthouse?&#8221; said the young
man.</p>

<p>The agent looked up, turned, and ran a measuring, speculative eye over the
new arrival. He noted the Eastern cut of the young man&#8217;s clothing and
beneath the dust of travel the clear, healthy white skin of his face.
&#8220;Stranger here?&#8221; observed the agent, with a slight, humorous
narrowing of the eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t mind,&#8221; resumed the agent, answering the young
man&#8217;s question. &#8220;You won&#8217;t have any trouble findin&#8217; the
courthouse. There&#8217;s only one street in this town an&#8217; the courthouse
is down to the other end of it&#8211;you couldn&#8217;t miss <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span> it if you tried.&#8221; He
grinned with some amusement at the young man&#8217;s back as the latter with a
cordial &#8220;thank you,&#8221; returned to his suit cases, gripped them firmly
by the handles, and strode down the wooden platform toward the street, ignoring
the group of loungers at the corner of the station.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Nother tenderfoot,&#8221; remarked one of the loungers as the young
man passed out of hearing; &#8220;they&#8217;re runnin&#8217; this country plum
to hell!&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man strode slowly down the board sidewalk that paralleled the
buildings on one side of the street, mentally taking in the dimensions of the
town. It was not an inviting picture. Many buildings of various descriptions
snuggled the wide, vacant space which the station agent had termed a
&#8220;street.&#8221; Most of the buildings were unpainted and crude, composed
of rough boards running perpendicularly, with narrow battens over the joints.
There were several brick buildings two stories in height, bearing the appearance
of having been recently erected, and these towered over the squat, one-story
frames in seeming contemptuous dignity. There were many private dwellings, some
stores, but the young man&#8217;s first impression was that there was an
enormous number of saloons.</p>

<p>He saw few people; those who came within <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_12'></a>12</span> range of vision were apparently cowboys, for they
were rigged in the picturesque garb that he had studied many times in the
illustrations of Eastern magazines. He had admired them afar, for there was
something about them, something in the free, wild life they led, that appealed
to him; something that struck at the primitive in his heart. He had heard tales
of them; travelers returning from these regions had related sundry stories of
these wild men of the plains; stories of their hardihood, of their recklessness,
of their absolute fearlessness&#8211;clothing them with a glamor and romance
that had deeply impressed the young man. His own life had been rather
prosaic.</p>

<p>He saw some cowponies hitched to rails in front of several of the saloons; in
front of a store he observed a canvas-covered wagon which he recognized (from
sketches he had seen) as a &#8220;prairie schooner&#8221;; in front of another
store he saw a spring wagon of the &#8220;buckboard&#8221; variety. That was
all. The aroma of sage-brush filled his nostrils; the fine, flint-like, powdered
alkali dust lay thick everywhere. It was unattractive and dismal.</p>

<p>The town, as it lay before him, began in desolation and ended in desolation.
Except that it was a trifle larger it differed in no important particular from
many others that littered the face <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_13'></a>13</span> of the world through which he had passed during the
last twenty-four hours. It was a mere dot in the center of a flat grass country
covering a vast area. It sat, serene in its isolation, as far from civilization
as Genesis from Revelation. In the stifling heat of the lazy June afternoon it
drowsed, seemingly deserted except for the ponies and the two wagons, and the
few incurious cowboys who had rewarded the young man with their glances.
Apparently whatever citizens were here were busy in the saloons. As this thought
flashed upon the young man his lips straightened grimly. But he continued slowly
on his way, giving much attention to objects that came within his range of
vision. The more he saw of the town, the less pleased he was with it.</p>

<p>The suit cases were heavy; he paused in front of a building and set them
down, while with his handkerchief he mopped the dust and perspiration from his
forehead. He saw a flaring sign on the roof of the building in front of which he
had stopped and he read the legend with a smile of derision: &#8220;The Fashion
Saloon.&#8221; Several ponies were hitched to the rail in front of the building;
the bridle of one was gaily decorated with a bow of ribbon. Only a woman would
have decorated a pony thus, the young man decided with a smile. Yet what sort of
woman <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span> would hitch
her pony in front of a saloon? He looked about him for some explanation and saw
a vacant space beside him and beside the vacant space a store. There was no
hitching rail in front of the store, therefore here was the explanation. He
heard a sound behind him and turning he beheld the figures of a man and a woman
in the vacant space between the two buildings.</p>

<p>The woman seemed to be little more than a girl, for as the young man watched
she turned slightly toward him&#8211;though not seeing him&#8211;and he saw
youth pictured on her face, and innocence, though withal she gave the young man
an impression of sturdy self-reliance that awakened instant admiration for her
in his mind.</p>

<p>She was attired in picturesque costume, consisting of short riding skirt,
boots, felt hat, woolen blouse with a flowing tie at the throat, gloves, and
spurs. It was not the sort of thing to which the young man was accustomed, but
she made an attractive picture and he took in every detail of her appearance
with eager eyes.</p>

<p>It was some time before he noticed the man. The latter stood facing the girl
and he could not get a view of his face. He had a gigantic frame, with huge
shoulders that loomed above the girl, dwarfing her. The young man remained
motionless, watching the two, for there was something <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span> in the big man&#8217;s attitude that held
him. The man turned presently and the young man had a glimpse of his face. It
was heavy featured, coarse, and an unmistakable brutality was betrayed in it.
The young man&#8217;s lips curled. He did not like the type, and it was the
girl&#8217;s face that held him now that he had seen the man&#8217;s.</p>

<p>He leaned easily against the front of the building, not over fifteen feet
distant from the two, trying to appear uninterested, but not concealing his
interest. He believed the girl had not seen him, for though she had looked in
his direction he was sure that her glance had passed him to rest on the pony at
the hitching rail. Swift as the glance had been the young man had seen in her
face an expression that caused him to decide to remain where he was until the
girl mounted her pony, no matter how long that time might be. So he relaxed,
leaning against the building&#8211;attentive, listening, though apparently
entirely unconcerned over their conversation.</p>

<p>The girl seemed moved with some deep emotion over something the big man had
said, for her slight figure had stiffened and she stood looking at him with an
angry, intense gaze. The big man had been taunting her, for his teeth showed in
a mocking grin as he hovered near her, apparently sure of her. It was like a
lion playing with <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span> a
mouse. Then the young man heard the big man&#8217;s voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;So you don&#8217;t take kindly to my courting? Don&#8217;t want
anything to do with me at all?&#8221; His forced laugh had a harshness in it
that caused the young man&#8217;s muscles to stiffen. He took a sly glance at
the girl and saw her chin uplift with disdain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think it necessary for me to tell you that&#8211;again?&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>A strange satisfaction thrilled the young man; sympathy for her drew his
mouth into a peculiarly grim smile. But he had no time to enjoy his satisfaction
for the big man spoke and this time he did not laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said shortly, &#8220;you&#8217;re going to have
something to do with me. You&#8217;re going to hook up with me or I&#8217;m
putting that crazy brother of yours out of business!&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl was suddenly rigid and a deep red as suddenly suffused her cheeks.
The young man&#8217;s face paled at the threat, his teeth came together with a
snap, and he leaned forward, wishing to hear some more of this extraordinary
conversation. More of it came quickly. The girl spoke, her voice even and well
controlled, though burdened with a biting sarcasm:</p>

<p>&#8220;What a terrible man you are, to be sure, to <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span> threaten to make war upon a defenseless
girl and her afflicted brother. But I&#8217;m not afraid of you!&#8221;</p>

<p>She took a step toward him, standing very close to him and looking straight
into his eyes. She was fighting bravely for her composure, but the young man had
seen that her lips had quivered pitifully during her brief speech. He stiffened
with sympathy. He could not, of course, understand this strange conversation,
but he could discern its drift, and the suggestive underplay in the big
man&#8217;s words. But plainly he had not been mistaken in his estimate of the
young woman&#8211;she seemed entirely able to take care of herself.</p>

<p>He crowded a little closer, though he knew that this conversation was none of
his affair further than that he was interested&#8211;as any man would be
interested&#8211;in seeing that the young woman received decent treatment.
Certainly so far she had not received that, yet neither had the big man said
anything to warrant interference by a stranger. Stealing another glance, the
young man saw a heavy revolver at the man&#8217;s hip, and he did not doubt,
from what he had thus far seen of him, that he would use the weapon should he
turn and discover that there was a listener to his conversation. Such an action
would accord <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
perfectly with tales that the young man had heard of this section of the
country. But he edged closer.</p>

<p>The big man&#8217;s face had become poisonously bloated. The girl&#8217;s
defiance seemed to have enraged him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hell!&#8221; he said venomously. &#8220;You&#8217;re talking damn
brave!&#8221; He leaned closer to her. &#8220;And you think you&#8217;d be
disgraced if folks knowed you was a friend of mine?&#8221; He laughed harshly.
&#8220;Most folks are tickled to be known as my friend. But I&#8217;m telling
you this: If I ain&#8217;t a friend I&#8217;m an enemy, and you&#8217;re doing
as I say or I&#8217;m making things mighty unpleasant for you and your poor,
&#8216;afflicted&#8217; brother!&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man saw the girl&#8217;s hands clench, saw her face grow slowly
pale. Twice now had the big man taunted her about her brother, and plainly his
words had hurt her. Words trembled on her lips but refused to come. But for an
instant she forced her eyes to meet those of the man and then they suddenly
filled with tears. She took a backward step, her shoulders drooping. The big man
followed her, gloating over her. Again the young man&#8217;s thoughts went to
the lion and the mouse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurts, does it?&#8221; said the big man, brutally. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span> &#8220;Well, you&#8217;ve
brought it on yourself, being such a damn prude!&#8221;</p>

<p>He reached out and grasped her by the shoulder. She shrank back, struggling
with him, trying to grasp the butt of an ivory-handled revolver that swung at
her right hip. The big man pinned her arms and the effort was futile.</p>

<p>And then retribution&#8211;like an avalanche&#8211;struck the big man. He
heard the movement, sensed the danger, and flung his right hand toward his
pistol butt. There was a silent struggle; a shot, one of the young man&#8217;s
arms swung out&#8211;flail like&#8211;the clenched hand landing with a crash.
The big man went down like a falling tree&#8211;prone to the ground, his
revolver flying ten feet distant, a little blue-white smoke curling lazily
upward out of its muzzle. The big man was raised again&#8211;bodily&#8211;and
hurled down again. He lay face upward in the white sunlight&#8211;a mass of
bruised and bleeding flesh.</p>

<p>The young man&#8217;s anger had come and gone. He stood over the big man,
looking down at him, his white teeth gleaming through his slightly parted
lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that will do for you,&#8221; he said in an even, passionless
voice.</p>

<p>For an instant there was a tense silence. The <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span> young man turned and looked at the girl,
who was regarding him with surprised and bewildered eyes.</p>

<p>The young man smiled mirthlessly. &#8220;I think I waited rather too long.
But he won&#8217;t bother you again&#8211;at least for a few minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>He saw the girl&#8217;s gaze directed to a point somewhere behind him and he
turned to see that a door in the side of the Fashion Saloon was vomiting men.
They came rushing out, filling the space between the two buildings&#8211;cowboys
mostly, with a sprinkling of other men whose appearance and attire proclaimed
them citizens. The young man stood silent while the newcomers ranged themselves
about him, others giving their attention to the big man who still lay on the
ground. The girl had not moved; she was standing near the young man, her face
pale, her slight figure rigid, her eyes wide and flashing. The young man looked
from her to the men who had crowded about him and he became aware that one of
the men&#8211;a slender, olive-skinned cowboy&#8211;evidently a
half-breed&#8211;was speaking to him. He stood looking at the man, saw menace in
his eyes, heard his voice, writhing in profane accusation:</p>

<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;ve shot Beeg Beel, you tenderfoot&#8213;!&#8221; said the
man. His right hand <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
was hooked in his cartridge belt, near the butt of his six-shooter.</p>

<p>The young man had been coldly scrutinizing the face of the half-breed; he had
seen a sneering insolence on the thin, snarling lips, and he knew instantly that
this man was a friend of his fallen adversary. He had smiled grimly when the man
had begun speaking, being willing to argue the justice of his action in striking
the big man, but at the man&#8217;s vile insult his white teeth gleamed again
and his right arm flew out&#8211;like a flail&#8211;the fist crashing against
the half-breed&#8217;s jaw. Like the big man the half-breed collapsed in a heap
on the ground. There was a sudden movement in the crowd, and pistols flashed in
the sunlight. The young man took a backward step, halted, drew himself up and
faced them, his lips curling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you&#8217;ll shoot now,&#8221; he said bitterly.</p>

<p>He heard a rustle beside him, and turned to see the girl standing within a
foot of him, the ivory-handled pistol in hand, her eyes flashing coldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that any of them are going to shoot,&#8221; she
declared evenly, her voice resounding in the sudden silence that had fallen;
&#8220;Big Bill got just what he deserved, and this gentleman <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span> will not be molested. He
isn&#8217;t armed,&#8221; she said, with a dry laugh; &#8220;shooting him would
be murder, and if he is shot I promise to avenge him immediately.&#8221; She
turned slightly, speaking to the young man while keeping her eyes on the men
around her. During the pause that followed her words several of the men
stealthily sheathed their weapons and stepped back.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think Big Bill is able to fight his own battles,&#8221; continued
the girl, taking advantage of the evident reluctance of the men to force
trouble.</p>

<p>Her face became slightly paler as she saw the big man sit up and stare about
him. He got to his feet and stood, swaying dizzily for an instant, and then his
gaze sought out the young man and was fixed on him with foreboding malignance.
His right hand fell to his holster, and finding no weapon there he turned and
sought it, finding it, and returning to a point near the young man, the weapon
in hand. As he halted there was another movement and the half-breed was on his
feet and dragging at his revolver. The young man crouched, prepared to spring,
and the big man spoke sharply to the half-breed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quit it!&#8221; he said, snarling. &#8220;Mind your own
business!&#8221; Then he seemed to realize that the half-breed had been worsted
also, for he <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span> looked
at the latter, saw the dust on his clothing and grinned expressively.</p>

<p>&#8220;So he got you too, did he, Yuma?&#8221; His heavy features wreathed
into a mocking sneer as he faced the young man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Knocked me down!&#8221; he said in a silky, even voice. &#8220;Knocked
me cold with a punch. Knocked Yuma Ed down too!&#8221; He took another step
toward the young man and surveyed him critically, his eyes glinting with
something very near amusement. Then he stepped back, laughing shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t shooting you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got an
idea that you and me will meet again.&#8221; There was an ominous threat in his
voice as he continued: &#8220;Shooting you wouldn&#8217;t half pay you back.
Mark that, young man&#8211;shooting you wouldn&#8217;t half pay you
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stepped away from the young man, motioning the other men into the door
through which they had emerged to come to his assistance, and they filed slowly
in without protest. The big man paused long enough to look again at the young
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Knocked me down!&#8221; he said as though scarcely able to realize the
truth; &#8220;knocked me cold with a punch!&#8221; He laughed, his coarse
features twisting into an odd expression. &#8220;Well, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span> I&#8217;ll be damned!&#8221; He turned
abruptly and disappeared through the door through which the other men had
gone.</p>

<p>For an instant the young man stood, looking after him. Then he turned and saw
the young woman, standing near her pony, regarding him with grave eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she said. He caught a flashing smile and then she
was in the saddle, loping her pony down the street toward the station. For a
moment the young man looked after her and then with a smile he returned to his
suit cases and was off down the street toward the courthouse, which he saw in
the distance.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span><a id='link_2'></a>CHAPTER II<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE RULE OF CATTLE</span></h2>

<p>The courthouse was a low, one-story redbrick building, sitting well back from
the street. It was evidently newly built, for an accumulation of débris, left by
the workmen, still littered the ground in the vicinity. A board walk led from
the street to the wide, arched entrance. From the steps one could look down the
street at the station and the other buildings squatting in the sunlight, dingy
with the dust of many dry days. Except for the cowponies and the buckboard and
the prairie schooner there was a total absence of life or movement, offering a
striking contrast to the bustling cities to which the young man had been
accustomed.</p>

<p>He walked rapidly down the board walk, entered the courthouse, and paused
before a door upon which appeared the legend: &#8220;United States District
Court. J. Blackstone Graney.&#8221; The young man set his suit cases down,
mopped his forehead with his handkerchief, making a wry face at the dust that
appeared on the linen after his use of it, and then knocked lightly, but <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span> firmly, on the door. A
voice inside immediately admonished him to &#8220;come in.&#8221; The young man
smiled with satisfaction, turned the knob and opened the door, standing on the
threshold. A man seated at one of the windows of the room was gazing steadily
out at the vast, dry, sun-scorched country. He turned at the young man&#8217;s
entrance and got slowly to his feet, apparently waiting for the visitor to
speak. He was a short man, not heavily, but stockily built, giving a clear
impression of stolidity. Yet there was a certain gleam in his eyes that gave the
lie to this impression, a gleam that warned of an active, analytical mind.
Judicial dignity lurked all over him.</p>

<p>The young man bowed respectfully. &#8220;Are you Judge Graney?&#8221; he
questioned.</p>

<p>The judge nodded and the young man smiled slightly. &#8220;I am Kent
Hollis,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The judge had been approaching a big table that stood in the center of the
room and at the young man&#8217;s words he took a second glance at him, but did
not hesitate in his walk toward the table. However, he smiled when he reached
it, sinking into a chair and motioning the young man to another.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been expecting you,&#8221; he said after he had become seated.
&#8220;Take a chair.&#8221; He <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_27'></a>27</span> waited until the young man had drawn a chair opposite
him and then he leaned over the table and stretched out his hand in greeting.
&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to see you,&#8221; he continued cordially. He held the
young man&#8217;s hand for an instant, peering steadily into the latter&#8217;s
unwavering eyes, apparently making a mental estimate of him. Then he dropped the
hand and sat back, a half smile on his face. &#8220;You look like your
father,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The young man&#8217;s face clouded. &#8220;Poor dad,&#8221; he said
slowly.</p>

<p>For a moment there was a silence; the judge studied the young man&#8217;s
face. Something that he saw in it must have pleased him, for he smiled, becoming
serious instantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry you could not get here in time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We
buried your father yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t make it,&#8221; returned the young man regretfully.
&#8220;I should have liked to see him before he died. Where did you bury
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We took him out to his ranch&#8211;the Circle Bar,&#8221; returned the
judge, &#8220;where he said he wanted to be buried when he died. You&#8217;ll
find that the Circle Bar boys have done their best for him&#8211;which was
little enough. Poor fellow, he deserved something better.&#8221; He looked
keenly at the young man.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>Lines of pain came
into the latter&#8217;s face; he bowed his head, nodding at the Judge&#8217;s
words.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have always thought that it was his own fault,&#8221; he said
gently. &#8220;It might have been different.&#8221; He looked slowly up at the
judge, his face reddening with embarrassment. &#8220;Of course you know
something of his life,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You were his friend&#8211;he wrote
me a while back, telling me that. I don&#8217;t pretend to know what came
between him and mother,&#8221; he continued; &#8220;mother would never tell and
father never mentioned it in his letters. I have thought it was drink,&#8221; he
added, watching the judge&#8217;s face closely. He caught the latter&#8217;s
slight nod and his lips straightened. &#8220;Yes, it must have been
drink,&#8221; he continued; &#8220;I have inferred that from what mother has
hinted now and then. But&#8213;&#8221; and a wistful gleam came into his
eyes&#8211;&#8220;I have hoped that it would not be drink that would cause
his&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>He caught the judge&#8217;s slow, grave nod and he broke off abruptly, his
eyes filling with an expression of resignation. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;it is ended, no matter what did it.&#8221; He shoved back his chair.
&#8220;I thank you for what you did for him,&#8221; he added, rising; &#8220;I
assure you that if it is possible for me to repay&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>&#8220;Sit
down,&#8221; said the judge, waving a hand to the young man&#8217;s chair.
&#8220;No thanks are due me. I did only what any friend would do for another. I
have arranged for you to go out to the Circle Bar,&#8221; he informed Hollis as
the latter hesitated over resuming his chair. &#8220;Neil Norton, your range
boss, is to be here at six o&#8217;clock with the buckboard.&#8221; He consulted
his watch. &#8220;He ought to be here in half an hour&#8211;if he is on time.
Meantime there are some things I would like to say to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis smiled. &#8220;Fire away,&#8221; he directed.</p>

<p>The judge leaned his elbows on the table and narrowed his eyes at Hollis.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t think my questions impertinent,&#8221; he said gravely,
&#8220;for I assure you that nothing is further from my mind than a desire to
pry into your affairs. But I take it you will need some advice&#8211;which, of
course, you may disregard if you wish. I suppose you don&#8217;t make a secret
of your age?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; was the instant reply, given with a grin, &#8220;I am
twenty-six.&#8221;</p>

<p>The judge smiled dryly. &#8220;We have great ambitions at twenty-six,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I remember that at twenty-six I was rather determined on making
the Supreme bench. You can see for yourself how far I missed it. I do not say
that we never realize our ambitions,&#8221; he added <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span> quickly as he saw a flash light up the
young man&#8217;s eyes; &#8220;I merely wish to show that in my case they were
rather extravagant.&#8221; He grimaced, continuing with a smile: &#8220;You are
a college man, of course&#8211;I can see that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis nodded. The judge continued, with an admiring glance at the young
man&#8217;s muscular frame and broad shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Went in for athletics&#8211;football, and such?&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Well,&#8221; he added, catching the young man&#8217;s nod, &#8220;it
didn&#8217;t hurt you a particle&#8211;it doesn&#8217;t hurt anybody. Rather
prepares a man for hard knocks&#8211;which he is sure to get sooner or later. If
you have decided to live in this country you must expect hard knocks. And I
presume you are going to live here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That depends.&#8221; returned Hollis. &#8220;If father has left his
affairs in such shape that it is necessary for me to stay here and straighten
them out, why of course I shall stay. Otherwise&#8213;&#8221; He hesitated and
laughed quietly, continuing: &#8220;Well, I also have an ambition, and if I am
compelled to remain here it will have to be sacrificed. It is a rather humble
ambition compared to yours,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;It is journalism,&#8221;
he continued, suddenly serious; &#8220;I want to own a newspaper. I am city
editor now and in a few years&#8213;&#8221; He laughed. &#8220;I am not <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span> going to prophesy, but I
have been working hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>The judge&#8217;s eyelashes flickered, but his face remained grave. &#8220;I
am afraid that you will have to remain here. That is&#8221;&#8211;he added
dryly&#8211;&#8220;if you expect to realize anything from the
property.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect there can&#8217;t be much property,&#8221; observed
Hollis.</p>

<p>The judge smiled. &#8220;A thousand acres of good grass land, some buildings,
and&#8221;&#8211;here the judge&#8217;s eyes gleamed and he drawled his
words&#8211;&#8220;a newspaper.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis sat erect. &#8220;A newspaper!&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;A newspaper in
this country? Why, man, a newspaper&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>The judge laughed. &#8220;So you will not have to go back East in order to be
able to realize your ambition&#8211;you can own a newspaper here&#8211;your
father&#8217;s newspaper&#8211;the Dry Bottom <i>Kicker</i>. It was quite a
recent venture; I believe it appeared about a dozen times&#8211;intermittently.
Ostensibly it was a weekly, but in reality it was printed at those times when
your father&#8217;s affliction sat least heavily upon him. He used to hire a
compositor from Las Vegas to set the type,&#8211;a man named Potter&#8211;a
worthless sort of fellow, but a genius in his way&#8211;when sober. I <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span> suspect that much of the
matter that went into the <i>Kicker</i> emanated from the brain of Dave
Potter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis&#8217;s smile revealed just a trace of derision. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t happen to know how father happened to think that a newspaper would
pay&#8211;in this place?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>The judge looked at him meditatively, a gleam of quiet amusement in his eyes.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t remember to have said that the paper made any money for
your father,&#8221; he returned slowly; &#8220;nor do I remember hearing your
father say that he expected it to make any money. As I understand the situation,
your father founded the paper on principle. He expected to use it as a
weapon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please go on,&#8221; urged Hollis. &#8220;That strikes me as a rather
Quixotic proceeding.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was, rather,&#8221; admitted the judge; &#8220;that is, it would
seem Quixotic as viewed by an Eastern newspaper man. But out here people are apt
to ignore money and methods in considering results. After you have been here a
while you will be able to see the force and truth of that statement. Your father
was after results and he seized upon the idea of founding a newspaper as a means
by which to obtain them. And I feel certain that had he lived he would have
succeeded.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>&#8220;I plead
ignorance,&#8221; said Hollis, watching the judge closely. &#8220;What
particular result did my father desire?&#8221;</p>

<p>Judge Graney&#8217;s eyes gleamed with earnestness. He leaned forward,
speaking slowly and distinctly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to illustrate my point by giving you a brief history of
your father&#8217;s experiences out here&#8211;as I had it from him. He came out
here about fifteen years ago and took up a quarter-section of land over on
Rabbit-Ear Creek, the present site of the Circle Bar ranch. For quite a few
years he was a nester&#8211;as the small owner is called in this country, but he
was unmolested for the reason that there were few large owners in the vicinity
and each man was willing that his neighbor should succeed. Your father prospered
and after a few years began to buy land. He finally acquired a thousand acres;
he told me that at one time he had about five thousand head of cattle. Of
course, these cattle could not live on your father&#8217;s thousand acres, but
the ranges are free and the thousand acres answered very well as a
headquarters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eight years ago some men in Santa Fe organized what is known as the
Union County Cattlemen&#8217;s Association. This company secured a section of
land adjoining your father&#8217;s property, on the other side of Rabbit-Ear
Creek. The <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span> company
called its ranch the Circle Cross. Perhaps it strikes you as peculiar that the
Association should have chosen a brand so closely resembling your
father&#8217;s. I will digress long enough to explain the action.&#8221;</p>

<p>The judge drew out a pencil and picked up a piece of paper that lay near him
on the desk, making some crude hieroglyphics and poising his pencil above
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; he explained, indicating a sketch which he had drawn, &#8220;is
the Circle Bar brand&#8211;a bar within a circle. And this&#8211;&#8221; indicating
another sketch, &#8220;&#8211;is the Circle Cross&#8211;a cross within a circle. It is
of course, perfectly obvious that all the Circle Cross company had to do when it
desired to appropriate one of the Circle Bar cattle was to add a vertical bar to
the Circle Bar brand and the brand became the Circle Cross. From a mechanical
standpoint it was a very trifling operation, the manipulator of the brands
having merely to apply the hot iron through a piece of wet blanket&#8211;that
gives a new brand the appearance of age.</p>

<p>&#8220;To get back to the main subject. The new company called its ranch the
Circle Cross and it erected new buildings within a few miles of the Circle Bar
buildings. Not long after the advent of the new company it tried to buy the
Circle <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span> Bar, but your
father refused to sell. Bill Dunlavey, the Circle Cross manager, attempted to
negotiate the purchase of the Circle Bar and when he was met with refusal hard
words passed between him and your father. Not long after that your father began
to miss cattle&#8211;rustlers began a systematic attack upon his herds. Your
father recognized this thievery as the work of the Cattlemen&#8217;s Association
and he fought back.</p>

<p>&#8220;A number of times he changed his brands but each time the company
checkmated him. To illustrate: Your father changed his brand to appear
thus:&#8221; The judge drew again on the paper. &#8220;That is the
&#8216;Wine-Glass&#8217; brand. You can see that it resembles a wine glass when held
up vertically, though of course as it appeared on the Circle Bar cattle it lay
on its side. But this move was futile, for among the Circle Cross cattle now
appeared many branded with the sign of the &#8216;Hour-Glass,&#8217; thus:&#8221; The
judge drew again. &#8220;This was achieved by merely adding a semi-circle to the
wine-glass, closing over the bowl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As I have said your father altered his brand a good many times. But
the Circle Bar cattle continued to disappear. Years of warfare followed. The
Cattlemen&#8217;s Association lost no opportunity to harass your father or, for
that matter, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span> all the
other small owners in the vicinity. Desperate, dissolute men were imported from
Texas and Arizona, men who took delight in the shedding of human blood. These
men roamed the ranges, stealing the Circle Bar cattle and killing Circle Bar
cowboys. Your father had trouble in keeping men; in order to surround himself
with enough men to protect his cattle and resist the aggressions of
Dunlavey&#8217;s hired assassins he was forced to pay ruinous wages.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even then he could not prevent rustling. Dunlavey bribed his men; his
herds dwindled; he saw that he was facing ruin if he did not devise some means
to successfully cope with his enemies. He went over to Santa Fe to see the
governor&#8211;a piffling carpet-bagger. He was told that the government was
powerless; that the same condition existed all over the country, and that the
government was unable to combat it. The Law had not come.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father returned home, discouraged but not beaten. He approached
the several other small owners in the vicinity, asking for co-operation and
assistance. Fearful of Dunlavey&#8217;s wrath, the small owners refused to
organize. But your father decided to carry on the fight alone. He recognized the
fact that nothing but the Law could defeat the association&#8217;s aims, and he
determined <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span> to force
the Law into the Territory. With this end in view he established his newspaper.
He succeeded in arousing public interest with the result that a court was
established here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The judge smiled dryly, continuing: &#8220;Yes, the Law is here. Or what is
more to the point, a representative of the Law is here. &#8216;I am the
Law,&#8217;&#8221; he quoted, ironically. &#8220;But my hands are tied; this
court is a mere travesty upon justice. The government at Washington has seen fit
to send me here&#8211;alone. I can&#8217;t go out and get evidence; I
couldn&#8217;t secure a conviction if I did. The people here who are not
Dunlavey&#8217;s friends were afraid of him. I can&#8217;t get a jury. Dunlavey
elects the sheriff&#8211;controls the election machinery. I am powerless&#8211;a
mere figurehead. This is the situation in a nutshell. I could go into detail,
but I imagine it is plain enough as it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis&#8217;s face had become gravely serious; his lips were straightened
with an expression that hinted at the conflict that was going on in his
mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t there an army post near?&#8221; he questioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Over at Fort Union&#8211;a hundred miles or so southwest. I have
pleaded for a detail, but have been informed that it can&#8217;t be had; that
the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span> soldiers are
needed to keep the Indians in order. Independent cattlemen are supposed to fight
it out alone. At least that is the inference, if we are to consider the attitude
of the government.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis was gravely silent. The judge leaned back in his chair, watching him
with a queer expression. He realized that he had said enough to discourage the
average young man from remaining in the country a moment longer than was
absolutely necessary. He would not have been surprised had Hollis told him that
he did not intend to remain. But from what he had seen of the young man he felt
sure that his decision, when it did come, would be final. More than once since
Hollis had been in the office had the judge observed the serene, steady gleam in
his eyes, and he had catalogued him with the rare class of men whose mental
balance is so perfect that nothing disturbs it. The judge had met a few such men
in the West and he knew the type. As he sat looking at the young man he decided
that Providence had made a mistake in allowing him to waste his time in the
East. The West teemed with opportunities for men of his kind.</p>

<p>He was not surprised at Hollis&#8217;s next question; it showed that he was
considering the situation from many angles before committing himself.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>&#8220;What is the
condition of Circle Bar ranch at present?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;The title to the land is intact and cannot be assailed. But Norton
informs me that there are not above two hundred head of cattle on the range, and
that the buildings are run down. Not a very cheerful prospect?&#8221;</p>

<p>He had told the truth about the land and the cattle, but he had purposely
exaggerated concerning the condition of the buildings, being grimly determined
to place the situation in its most unfavorable light that he might be the better
able to test the young man&#8217;s mettle. He smiled as Hollis thoughtfully
stroked his chin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now,&#8221; admitted the latter, flashing a queer smile at the
judge, &#8220;I quite agree with you that the prospect isn&#8217;t cheering. But
so long as the condition is such as it is there is no need to grumble. I
didn&#8217;t come out here expecting to fall into a bed of roses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you won&#8217;t be disappointed,&#8221; returned the judge dryly.
He filled and lighted a pipe, smoking meditatively, his eyes on the younger man
with a curious expression. He had determined to push the test a little
farther.</p>

<p>&#8220;You could probably sell the Circle Bar,&#8221; he said finally.
&#8220;Your father told me before he died that he had been offered ten dollars
an acre <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span> for his
land. That would total to a tidy sum.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis looked quickly at the judge, his eyes flashing with grim amusement.
&#8220;Would you advise me to sell?&#8221; he questioned.</p>

<p>The judge laughed quietly. &#8220;That is an unfair question,&#8221; he
equivocated, narrowing his eyes whimsically. &#8220;If I were heir to the
property and felt that I did not care to assume the danger of managing it I
should sell, without doubt. If, on the other hand, I had decided to continue my
father&#8217;s fight against an unscrupulous company, I would stay no matter
what the consequences. But&#8221;&#8211;He puffed slowly at his pipe, his voice
filling with unmistakable sarcasm&#8211;&#8220;it would be so much easier to
sell and return at once to a more peaceful atmosphere. With ten thousand dollars
you could go back East and go on with your newspaper work, well equipped, with a
chance of realizing your ambition&#8211;and not be troubled with continuing a
fight in which, no doubt, there would be many blows to be taken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; returned Hollis quietly. He looked steadily into the
judge&#8217;s eyes, his own glinting with a grim humor. &#8220;You have
succeeded in making it very plain,&#8221; he continued slowly. &#8220;But I am
not going to run&#8211;I have decided on that. Of course I feel properly
resentful over the way my father has been treated by this man Dunlavey and his
association.&#8221; His <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_41'></a>41</span> eyes flashed with a peculiar hardness. &#8220;And I
would stay here and fight Dunlavey and his parcel of ruffians if for no other
reason than to secure revenge on personal grounds.</p>

<p>&#8220;But there is one other reason. There is a principle at stake. I
don&#8217;t care very much about the personal side of the question; little as I
knew my father, I believe he would have ignored personalities were he confronted
with the condition that confronts me. It is my belief that as an American
citizen he chafed under conditions that prevented him from enjoying that freedom
to which we are all entitled under the Constitution. Judging from your
conversation you are in entire sympathy with that sentiment.&#8221; He smiled at
the judge. &#8220;Of course I am not mistaken?&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>The tobacco in the bowl of the judge&#8217;s pipe spluttered; he brought his
right fist heavily down upon the table, rattling the pens and ink bottles that
littered its top. &#8220;No, young man; you are not mistaken&#8211;you have hit
the nail squarely on the head. If you are going to stay here and fight Dunlavey
and his crew, Blackstone Graney is with you until&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Until the Law comes,&#8221; suggested Hollis.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, by thunder!&#8221; declared the judge. &#8220;You can go further
than that and say: &#8216;until the Law rules!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span><a id='link_3'></a>CHAPTER III<br /><span class='h2fs'>NORTON MAKES A DISCOVERY</span></h2>

<p>Judge Graney rose and leaned over the table, taking the young man&#8217;s
hand and holding it tightly. Then he sat down again and resumed smoking. Neither
man said a word during the hand-clasp and yet both knew that their hearts and
minds were united in a common cause. Words would have been unnecessary and
futile.</p>

<p>Hollis&#8217;s path of duty lay straight and open before him. There was no
by-way that would lead him around the dangers that were sure to beset him. Nor
had he thought to search for any. Long before the judge had concluded his
recital of conditions in the county Hollis had decided to meet the issue
squarely. He had been able to see beyond the petty, personal side of the
question; had even ignored it to get at the big, pithy principle of equal
rights. The Law must come. If he could assist in bringing it he would be
accomplishing something real and tangible <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_43'></a>43</span> and he would be satisfied. He did not believe that
Destiny had anything to do with his appearance upon the scene at this particular
time; rather he felt that his coming was merely a result of a combination of
circumstances such as might have occurred to any man. And like any man with
courage and deeply settled convictions he was prepared to move forward to the
issue, trusting himself. He had no thought of appearing heroic.</p>

<p>Yet to the judge he appeared so. The latter had been prepared to hear excuses
from him; had been prepared to resist a natural inclination to berate the young
man soundly for lack of parental loyalty, though conscious that he could advance
no valid reason for the young man sacrificing himself upon the altars of an old
feud. It was against human nature for any man to so sacrifice himself, he had
assured himself when trying to build up a defense for the young man.</p>

<p>And now that Hollis had shown that he needed no defender; that he was willing
to take up the cudgels in behalf of his father, the judge was scarcely able to
restrain himself. To state calmly that he intended to fight the
Cattlemen&#8217;s Association when there was a life of comparative safety
awaiting him in another section of the country was an heroic decision. Many
another <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span> man would
have cringed&#8211;would have surrendered without striking a blow.</p>

<p>Judge Graney had long known that the action of his government in sending him
to Union County was an ironical surrender on the part of the government to the
forces in the West which had been long demanding the Law. He had been sent here,
presumably to enforce the law, but in reality to silence the government&#8217;s
critics. He was not expected to convict anyone. Theoretically he was supposed to
uphold the majesty of the law in Union County, but in reality he merely remained
and drew his salary. There was no law to enforce.</p>

<p>In the fight that had been waged between the elder Hollis and the
Cattlemen&#8217;s Association his sympathies had been with Hollis, though he had
never been able to assist him in a legal way. But the judge knew that eventually
the Law must come, and so he encouraged Hollis, assuring him that victory would
be his in the end.</p>

<p>And then Hollis had died&#8211;suddenly. The Las Vegas doctor who had
attended him had shaken his head sagely when the judge had questioned him
regarding his patient and had pointed significantly to one of Dry Bottom&#8217;s
saloons. The doctor had told the judge there was no hope, and the latter had
telegraphed East. The appearance of young Hollis had been the result. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span> The judge&#8217;s heart
had warmed toward the young man.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are your intentions regarding the newspaper&#8211;the
<i>Kicker</i>?&#8221; he questioned.</p>

<p>Hollis looked up quickly, his face grave. &#8220;Perhaps if there had been no
<i>Kicker</i> here my decision might have been different,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;But so long as it is here it is in business to stay!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect that decision won&#8217;t please Dunlavey a whole lot,&#8221;
the judge returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps not,&#8221; drawled Hollis; &#8220;still, we can&#8217;t aim
to please everybody. I expect I might be able to get hold of that
printer&#8211;Potter I believe you called him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Potter won&#8217;t be hard to find,&#8221; assured the judge; &#8220;a
search of the saloons would uncover him, I imagine.&#8221; He smiled.
&#8220;When you get ready to get the <i>Kicker</i> out just let me know; I
promise to have Potter on hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>To the ears of the two men came a rattle of wheels and a voice. The judge
leaned back in his chair and looked out through the window. His face wreathed
into a broad smile as he resumed his former position and looked at Hollis.
&#8220;Your range boss is here,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>They heard a step on the board walk, and a man stood in the doorway looking
at them.</p>

<p>The newcomer gave an instant impression of <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_46'></a>46</span> capability. He stood on the threshold, entirely
composed, saturnine, serene eyed, absolutely sure of himself. He was arrayed in
high heeled boots, minus spurs; the bottoms of a pair of dust-covered overalls
were tucked into the boot legs; a woolen shirt, open at the throat, covered a
pair of admirable shoulders; a scarlet handkerchief was knotted around his neck;
and a wide brimmed hat, carelessly dented in the crown, was shoved rakishly back
from his forehead. Sagging from his slim waist was a well filled cartridge belt
and at the right hip a heavy revolver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Howdy, judge!&#8221; he said with a smile, in response to Judge
Graney&#8217;s cordial greeting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just come in?&#8221; questioned the judge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Been in town an hour,&#8221; returned Norton.</p>

<p>He flashed a searching glance at Hollis, which that young man met steadily.
The thought crossed Hollis&#8217;s mind that the buckboard that he had seen in
front of a store soon after leaving the station must have been Norton&#8217;s.
But now Norton was speaking again and Hollis listened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dropped into the Fashion to see my friend Red Eggers,&#8221; resumed
Norton, smiling broadly. &#8220;Same old crowd&#8211;Dunlavey, Yuma Ed, Ten
Spot, Greasy&#8211;most of the bunch which has been makin&#8217; things
interestin&#8217; for us hereabouts.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the mention of &#8220;Yuma Ed&#8221; Hollis looked <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span> up. That was the name of the second man
he had struck in the affair near the Fashion Saloon. He wondered if Norton knew.
He did not remember to have seen the latter among the men who had surrounded him
in the space between the two buildings. But the judge was now introducing him to
Norton and he stood up, holding the latter&#8217;s hand and meeting his
inspecting gaze fairly. He found that the range boss was fully as tall as he;
indeed, Hollis discovered that he was compelled to look up slightly in order to
meet the latter&#8217;s level gaze. Norton smiled peculiarly; there was a
friendly expression in his eyes, but mingled with it was a reserved, appraising,
speculative gleam, which drew a smile to Hollis&#8217;s lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re Jim Hollis&#8217;s boy?&#8221; said Norton. &#8220;My
new boss?&#8221; He grinned, evidently willing to go more than half way in
forming a friendship with his &#8220;new boss&#8221;. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
reckon that you&#8217;re much stuck on this here country&#8211;much as
you&#8217;ve seen of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been used to keeping busy,&#8221; laughed Hollis,
&#8220;and my impression is that it seems rather dull out here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Norton&#8217;s eyelashes flickered. He deliberately closed one eye at the
judge, carefully averting his face so that Hollis could not see.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>&#8220;So
you&#8217;re lookin&#8217; for action?&#8221; he said to Hollis in a grave
voice. &#8220;Mebbe it ain&#8217;t none of my business,&#8221; he added, his
eyes gleaming, &#8220;but I&#8217;m askin&#8217; you if you&#8217;re
thinkin&#8217; to stay in this country&#8211;keepin&#8217; your dad&#8217;s
ranch an&#8217; his newspaper?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis nodded. Norton&#8217;s eyes gleamed with a savage delight.
&#8220;Bully!&#8221; he declared. &#8220;If you stay here you&#8217;ll get
plenty of action. I was afraid you wouldn&#8217;t stay.&#8221; He turned to
Judge Graney, a grin of satisfaction on his face. &#8220;I&#8217;m tellin&#8217;
you somethin&#8217; that will tickle you a heap,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I told
you that I had stopped in Red Egger&#8217;s saloon. I did. Dunlavey&#8217;s
bunch was feelin&#8217; mighty sore over somethin&#8217;. I stayed there a
while, tryin&#8217; to find out what it was all about, but there wasn&#8217;t
none of them sayin&#8217; anything to me. But pretty soon I got Red over into a
corner an&#8217; he told me. Accordin&#8217; to him Dunlavey had corraled that
Hazelton girl outside an&#8217; was tellin&#8217; her somethin&#8217; pretty
strong when a tenderfoot, which hadn&#8217;t any regard for Dunlavey&#8217;s
delicate feelin&#8217;s, up an&#8217; lambasted him in the jaw!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Struck him?&#8221; queried the judge, grinning delightedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Knocked him cold,&#8221; affirmed Norton, his eyes dancing.
&#8220;Pasted him so hard that he thought it was night an&#8217; went to sleep.
Then Yuma <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span> busted in
an&#8217; thought to work his guns. He got his&#8217;n, too. That there
tenderfoot didn&#8217;t have no respect for guns. Red says he never thought any
man could hit so hard. It must have been sumptuous!&#8221; He laughed
delightedly. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to shake hands with that
tenderfoot&#8211;he&#8217;s my friend!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis pulled out a cigar case, selected a cigar, lighted it, and smoked in
silence.</p>

<p>So her name was Hazelton. Admiration over the manner in which she had held
the men at bay before Dunlavey got to his feet still lingered; she had impressed
him deeply. But a deeper satisfaction overshadowed his thoughts of the girl, for
he had slugged Dunlavey, his father&#8217;s enemy. His satisfaction grew to
amusement. Did Dunlavey know who had slugged him? He must have suspected, for
Hollis recalled the man&#8217;s significant expression when, after he had risen
from the ground he said: &#8220;I&#8217;ve got an idea that you an&#8217; me
will meet again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis&#8217;s thoughts flitted rapidly from Dunlavey to the girl. Now that
he had decided to stay he had determined to search her out. He remembered that
Dunlavey had spoken slightingly of her brother and he assured himself that he
would not be entirely satisfied until he had uncovered the mystery. He might
have questioned <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
Norton or the judge, for both men evidently knew the girl, but he was reluctant
to betray his interest in her to either man.</p>

<p>He heard Norton make an exclamation of surprise, and looking up he saw him
holding his right hand out, the palm upward, examining it. There was a splotch
of blood on the palm and another on the under side of the thumb.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shucks!&#8221; Norton was saying. &#8220;Now where in thunder did I
get that?&#8221; He looked again at the hand and then suddenly dove forward to
Hollis&#8217;s side, seized his right hand, peered at the knuckles and held the
hand triumphantly aloft.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon this is where I got it!&#8221; he grinned.</p>

<p>Hollis looked ruefully down at his knuckles. The skin was
gashed&#8211;evidently where it had come in contact with a bone in either
Dunlavey&#8217;s or Yuma&#8217;s jaw. He had intended to keep the story of
adventure to himself. But he saw that Norton had stepped back and was gazing
soberly at the suitcases, which Hollis had deposited near the door. Norton
suddenly let out a chirp of delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two of them!&#8221; he said, suppressing his excitement; &#8220;Two
grips! Red Eggers said there was two an&#8217; that the tenderfoot had come down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span> toward the court
house!&#8221; He walked to Hollis and halted in front of him, looking at him
with admiration and satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Own up now!&#8221; he said. &#8220;You ain&#8217;t tellin&#8217; us
that it wasn&#8217;t you, durn you! Oh, say!&#8221; He uttered a whoop that must
have startled the horses in front of the building. Then he sobered down,
speaking in a low, regretful voice: &#8220;You durn tenderfoot! Here I&#8217;ve
been waitin&#8217; for years to get a crack at that big four-flusher, an&#8217;
here you come, a-fannin&#8217; along from your little old East an&#8217; get
ahead of me!&#8221; He stifled a cackle of mirth. &#8220;An&#8217; so
you&#8217;re lookin&#8217; for action? Lordy! If you don&#8217;t call what you
done to Dunlavey an&#8217; Yuma action this country&#8217;s goin&#8217; to set
up an&#8217; take notice when you get to goin&#8217; in earnest!&#8221;</p>

<p>Judge Graney loomed somberly over the table. &#8220;I suppose it must have
been you?&#8221; he said gravely.</p>

<p>Hollis nodded. &#8220;I may as well confess,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I saw a
man giving a young lady a mighty bad moment and I slugged him. Another man
called me a vile name and I slugged him, too. That was all.&#8221;</p>

<p>The judge sat down again, his face slightly pale. A significant glance passed
between him and Norton, but the latter laughed grimly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>&#8220;I reckon
he&#8217;s opened the ball, right off the reel,&#8221; he suggested.</p>

<p>Judge Graney drew a deep breath. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he returned. &#8220;I
suppose that way is as good as any other. It was bound to come anyway. It will
be war to the finish now!&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span><a id='link_4'></a>CHAPTER IV<br /><span class='h2fs'>AT THE CIRCLE BAR</span></h2>

<p>In the two weeks that followed his arrival at Dry Bottom, Hollis had much
time to meditate upon the great change that had come into his life. His
conclusion that there was nothing in common between cattle raising and
journalism was not a result of an involved process of reasoning, and had he not
been endowed with a sense of humor he might have become embittered. Though a
sacrifice be made cheerfully, there lingers always its ghost to draw mental
pictures of &#8220;what might have been.&#8221; Hollis would have been more than
human had he not felt some little regret over his sacrifice.</p>

<p>It had seemed to him, as two weeks before he had ridden away from the court
house&#8211;sitting on the seat of the buckboard beside Neil Norton, his
suitcases tucked snugly away underneath&#8211;that he was once and for all
severing his connection with the big, bustling world in which he had moved; in
whose busy scenes he had been so vitally interested. His had been a big work;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span> seated at his desk
in the &#8220;city&#8221; room of his newspaper he had many times likened
himself unto an argus-eyed recording angel whose business it was to keep in view
each of the many atoms of a busy multitude and to accord to them that amount of
space that their importance seemed to demand. He had loved his work; it had
broadened him, had provided him with exactly the proportion of mental exercise
needed to keep him on edge and in a position to enjoy life. He had lived in the
East&#8211;really lived. Out here he would merely exist, though, he assured
himself grimly, his enemies would have to pay dearly for his sacrifice.</p>

<p>The picture of his journey to the Circle Bar ranch was still fresh in his
mind as he rode slowly away from Neil Norton, whom he had left sitting in his
saddle on a ridge, watching him. The long twilight had brought its lengthening
shadows that night before Norton had struck the Circle Bar trail, and before
they had traveled a mile of the ten that lay before them night had come. Hollis
had been little inclined to talk and Norton did not disturb him, but gave his
attention to the horses. There had been no moon and few stars, and darkness, as
under a blanket, had settled over them before they were many miles from Dry
Bottom.</p>

<p>The country seemed nothing more than a vast <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_55'></a>55</span> plain, broken here and there by ridges and
depressions. Occasionally a low hill loomed out of the darkness, the shadows
deepening around it; now and then the buckboard passed through a draw, the
wheels sinking hub-deep in the loose sand. Several dry arroyos crossed the
trail, but with a knowledge that seemed almost marvelous Norton cleverly avoided
these pitfalls. Hollis could not see a foot ahead, but the location of the trail
seemed to be no mystery to the range boss, for he drove the horses steadily on,
hesitating for nothing.</p>

<p>Once during the ride Norton broke the silence with a subdued cackle of mirth,
and at another time he laughed aloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d liked to have seen Big Bill when you hit him!&#8221; he
observed, regret in his voice. &#8220;I reckon he might have been just a little
surprised!&#8221;</p>

<p>To which Hollis made no reply. At another time Norton broke the silence long
enough to inquire:</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon mebbe you wouldn&#8217;t have hit him so hard if you&#8217;d
knowed who he was?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I should have hit a little harder,&#8221; returned Hollis
quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, hell!&#8221; declared Norton with a laugh; &#8220;I reckon you
would have done just that!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>About ten
o&#8217;clock they came in sight of some straggling posts, and Norton assured
Hollis that the posts were strung with wire, forming a fence which skirted one
side of the Circle Bar pasture. A few minutes later a dog barked and at
Norton&#8217;s call came bounding up to the buckboard, yipping joyously. Hollis
could make out his shape as he cavorted about.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dog,&#8221; offered the range boss. &#8220;Half wolf, the other
half just dog.&#8221; He chuckled over his joke. &#8220;Best dog you ever
see,&#8221; he boasted; &#8220;money couldn&#8217;t buy him. Like
dogs?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis nodded and then realizing that Norton could not see him in the
darkness, voiced a quick &#8220;yes&#8221;.</p>

<p>In the distance Hollis saw a sudden square of light illuminate the wall of
darkness into which they had been driving; a door had been opened. Evidently the
dog&#8217;s barking had aroused the inmates of the building, for as the
buckboard drew nearer Hollis saw several figures flit out of the door-way.
Norton drove the horses close to the building and brought them to a halt with a
sonorous &#8220;whoa&#8221;! Then he turned to Hollis and spoke with a drawl:
&#8220;This here building is the Circle Bar bunkhouse; them&#8217;s some of your
men.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis remarked the size of the building and Norton laughed grimly.
&#8220;There was a time <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_57'></a>57</span> when it wasn&#8217;t any too big,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Five years ago your dad had twenty-seven men on the pay-roll. If Dunlavey
an&#8217; his damn association hadn&#8217;t showed up he&#8217;d have had them
yet.&#8221; He turned toward three men who were lounging in the doorway.
&#8220;Hey, you guys!&#8221; he yelled; &#8220;this here&#8217;s your new boss.
If you-all ain&#8217;t glued there you might grab his grips an&#8217; tote them
up to the ranchhouse. Tell the missus that I&#8217;ll be along directly with the
boss.&#8221;</p>

<p>Amusement over the Southern twang that marked Norton&#8217;s speech filled
Hollis. He had noticed it before and it had made plain to him the reason of
Norton&#8217;s unhurried movements, his slow humor, his habit of quiet
scrutiny.</p>

<p>But he had little time for reflection. At Norton&#8217;s words two men sprang
forward to the buckboard and he saw his suitcases disappear into the darkness in
the direction of a light that he now saw flickering from some little distance.
He jumped out of the buckboard and saw another man spring to the horses&#8217;
heads and lead them away into the darkness. Then he followed Norton into the
light from the open doorway. Presently he was shaking hands with a man who stood
there, whose chief articles of raiment were overalls, boots, and a woolen shirt.
Almost instantly, it seemed, two of the others had returned <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span> and Norton was introducing them as
&#8220;Ace,&#8221; &#8220;Lanky,&#8221; and &#8220;Weary.&#8221; These
pseudonyms were picturesque and descriptive, though at the time Hollis was in a
state of pained incomprehension concerning them. Later he was informed that Ace
had been so named on account of having once been caught slipping a playing card
of that character into his bootleg during a game of poker.
Incidentally&#8211;Hollis was told&#8211;gun-play had resulted. That Ace was
still active proved that the other man might have profited by keeping his
knowledge to himself. Obviously, Lanky deserved his appellation&#8211;he was a
trifle over six feet tall and proportioned like a young sapling. Weary had been
born tired&#8211;so Hollis was told by the latter&#8217;s defamers; defamers,
for later Hollis discovered that no man in the outfit could show more surprising
agility on occasion than this same Weary.</p>

<p>Hollis found himself inside the bunkhouse, where he was critically inspected
by the three men&#8211;and before he left, by the fourth, who answered to the
name of &#8220;Bud.&#8221; Norton told him that these four comprised his
outfit&#8211;Bud acting as blacksmith. Hollis remained with the men only long
enough to announce that there would be no change; that he intended to hang on
and fight for his rights. When Norton told them <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_59'></a>59</span> that Hollis had already begun the fight by slugging
Dunlavey and Yuma Ed, the enthusiasm of the four men was unbounded. They assured
him profanely that they were with him to the &#8220;finish&#8221;&#8211;whatever
it might be. After which Hollis departed to the ranchhouse.</p>

<p>He found Mrs. Norton to be a pleasant faced woman of twenty-seven or eight,
who had&#8211;according to Norton&#8211;&#8220;bossed him for seven
years.&#8221; Norton grinned hugely over his wife&#8217;s embarrassed
protest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t &#8216;bossed&#8217; him,&#8221; she told Hollis, while
Norton looked on with amusement, &#8220;though there have been times when he
richly deserved it.&#8221; There was a spirited flash in the lady&#8217;s eyes
as she looked at her lord.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wish to take sides in any marital controversy,&#8221;
Hollis told them. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care to parade my ignorance.
However,&#8221; he smiled, with a wink at Norton, &#8220;most men need a boss,
if for no other reason than to teach them the value of discipline.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; said Mrs. Norton with a triumphant laugh, and
immediately left the two men and went into the kitchen.</p>

<p>After partaking of a hearty meal Hollis and Norton went out on the porch for
a smoke and a talk, and it was near midnight when Hollis <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span> tumbled into bed, distinctly pleased with
the range boss and his admirable wife. He was asleep within five minutes.</p>

<p>The sun was streaming into his window when he hopped out of bed the next
morning, refreshed and eager to make a trip of inspection over his property. He
came down stairs lightly, in the hope of being able to slip outside without
disturbing anybody, but upon opening the stair door he was surprised to find the
cloth on the table in the dining room already spread and hot food steaming upon
it. Mrs. Norton was bustling about from the kitchen to the dining room.
Evidently the Nortons had been astir for hours.</p>

<p>Mrs. Norton smilingly directed him to a wash basin on a bench just outside
the door and stood in the opening a moment, watching him as he drenched his face
with the cold water. There was in her manner only the solicitous concern of the
hostess whose desire is to place a guest at ease. Hollis decided that Norton had
been most fortunate in his choice of a &#8220;boss.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neil has gone down into the big basin to look after the men,&#8221;
she told him from the doorway. &#8220;I don&#8217;t expect him to return for
some little time. Come in to breakfast when you are ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>To his protest that he would wait until Norton&#8217;s <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span> return before breakfasting she replied
with a smile that her husband had already breakfasted, telling him also that in
this part of the country everyone rose with the sun.</p>

<p>He stood on the edge of the porch for a moment after washing, drinking in the
air that came to him from the plains&#8211;a breeze laden with the clear aroma
of the sage-brush moist with the dew of the night. When he entered the house
Mrs. Norton was nowhere to be seen and he drew up a chair and breakfasted
alone.</p>

<p>A little later he embarked upon a tour of inspection. All of the buildings,
with the exception of the ranchhouse, which was constructed of logs, with a
gable roof and plastered interstices&#8211;were built of adobe, low, squat
structures with flat roofs. There were six of them&#8211;the bunkhouse, mess
house, blacksmith shop, the range boss&#8217;s private shack (from which Norton
and his wife had removed after the death of the elder Hollis), the stable, and
one other building for the storing of miscellaneous articles. Hollis inspected
them all and was not quite convinced that they had reached the stage of
dilapidation suggested by Judge Graney.</p>

<p>During his inspection Hollis had seen a patch of garden, some chickens, and
down in a small pasture some cows that he supposed were kept <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span> for milking. He was
leaning on the top rail of the corral fence after he had concluded his trip of
inspection when he heard a clatter of hoofs behind him and turned to observe
Norton, just riding up to the corral gate. The range boss wore a grin of
pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;How you findin&#8217; things?&#8221; he questioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;In better shape than I expected&#8211;after listening to Judge
Graney,&#8221; smiled Hollis.</p>

<p>Norton looked critically at him. &#8220;Then you ain&#8217;t changed your
mind about stayin&#8217; here?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; returned Hollis; &#8220;I believe I shall get used to it in
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Norton dismounted, his eyes alight with satisfaction. &#8220;That&#8217;s the
stuff!&#8221; he declared. He threw the reins over his pony&#8217;s head and
seized Hollis by an arm. &#8220;Come along with me&#8211;down to my
shack,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I&#8217;ve got somethin&#8217; to show
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without further words he led Hollis toward a building&#8211;the one he had
occupied previous to the death of the elder Hollis. There were three rooms in
the building and in the front one were several articles of furniture and some
boxes. One of these boxes Norton opened, taking therefrom several articles of
wearing apparel, consisting of a pair of corduroy trousers, a pair of <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span> leathern chaps, boots,
spurs, two woolen shirts, a blue neckerchief, a broad felt hat, and last, with a
grin of amusement over Hollis&#8217;s astonished expression, a cartridge belt to
which was attached a holster containing a Colt .45.</p>

<p>&#8220;I bought this outfit over at Santa Fé two months ago,&#8221; he
informed Hollis, who was gravely contemplating the lay-out,
&#8220;expectin&#8217; to wear them myself some day. But when I got home I found
they didn&#8217;t quite fit.&#8221; He surveyed Hollis with a critical eye.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinkin&#8217; ever since you come that you&#8217;d fit
pretty snug in them.&#8221; He raised a protesting hand as Hollis was about to
speak. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t givin&#8217; them to you,&#8221; he grinned.
&#8220;But you can&#8217;t wear no tenderfoot clothes out here. Some day when
we&#8217;re together an&#8217; we&#8217;ve got time you can blow me to another
outfit; I won&#8217;t hesitate about takin&#8217; it.&#8221; He leaned over and
tapped the butt of the Colt. &#8220;You ever handle one of them?&#8221; he
questioned.</p>

<p>Hollis nodded. Once during a shooting tournament he had done good work with a
pistol. But Norton laughed at his nod.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mebbe we do it a little different out here,&#8221; he smiled.
&#8220;You hop into them duds an&#8217; we&#8217;ll go out into the cottonwood
yonder an&#8217; try out your gun.&#8221; He pointed through the door to a <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span> small clump of cottonwoods
beyond the bunkhouse.</p>

<p>He went out and fifteen minutes later Hollis joined him, looking thoroughly
at home in his picturesque rigging. An hour later they returned to the corral
fence, where Norton caught up his pony and another, saddling the latter for
Hollis. He commented briefly upon the new owner&#8217;s ability with the
six-shooter.</p>

<p>&#8220;You use your fists a little better than you use a gun,&#8221; he
remarked with his peculiar drawl, &#8220;but I reckon that on the whole
you&#8217;ll be able to take care of yourself&#8211;after you&#8217;ve had a
little practise gettin&#8217; your gun out.&#8221; He laughed with a grim humor.
&#8220;More men have been killed in this country on account of bein&#8217; slow
on the draw than for any other reason. Don&#8217;t never monkey with it unless
you intend to use it, an&#8217; then see that you get it out middlin&#8217;
rapid. That&#8217;s the recipe,&#8221; he advised.</p>

<p>The pony that he had selected for Hollis was a slant-eyed beast, larger than
the average, with rangy limbs, black in color with a white muzzle and fetlocks.
Hollis voted him a &#8220;beaut&#8221; after he had ridden him a mile or two and
found that he had an easy, steady stride.</p>

<p>Together they made a round of the basin, returning to the ranchhouse for
dinner. Hollis <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span> was
saddle weary and when Norton proposed another trip during the afternoon he was
met with the response that the new owner purposed enjoying the cool of the
ranchhouse porch for the remainder of the day.</p>

<p>The next morning Hollis was up with the dawn and out on the porch splashing
water over his face from the wash basin that stood outside the door. For a long
time after washing he stood on the porch, looking out over the big basin at this
new and strange world. Endless it seemed, lying before him in its solemn
silence; a world of peace, of eternal sunlight, smiling skies, and infinite
distance. It seemed unreal to him. Did this same planet hold the busy cities to
which he had been accustomed? The stuffy room, with its smell of damp ink, its
litter of papers&#8211;his room in the newspaper offices, filled with desks and
the clatter of typewriters? Through whose windows came the incessant clamor that
welled up from the streets below? He laughed at the thought and turned to see
Norton standing in the doorway looking at him with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Comparin&#8217; her with your little old East?&#8221; inquired the
latter.</p>

<p>Hollis confessed that he had been doing something of that sort.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; returned Norton, &#8220;there ain&#8217;t any <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span> way to compare this
country with anything else. Seems as though when the world was made the Lord had
a few million miles left which he didn&#8217;t know what to do with an&#8217; so
he just dumped it down out here. An&#8217; then, havin&#8217; business somewhere
else about that time he forgot about it an&#8217; left it to get along as best
it could&#8211;which wasn&#8217;t none too rapid.&#8221;</p>

<p>This conversation had taken place just twelve days ago, yet Norton&#8217;s
words still remained fresh in Hollis&#8217;s mind. Yet he did not altogether
agree with Norton. The West had impressed him far more than he cared to
admit.</p>

<p>This morning, directly after breakfast Hollis and Norton had saddled their
horses and ridden out of the basin toward the river, into a section of the
country that Hollis had not yet explored. Emerging from the basin, they came to
a long, high ridge. On its crest Norton halted. Hollis likewise drew in his
pony. From here they could see a great stretch of country, sweeping away into
the basin beneath it, toward a mountain range whose peaks rose barren and smooth
in the white sunlight.</p>

<p>&#8220;This here&#8217;s &#8216;Razor-Back&#8217; ridge,&#8221; explained Norton as
the ponies halted; &#8220;called that on account of bein&#8217; so unusually
narrow on the top.&#8221; He pointed to some buildings which Hollis had seen but
to which he had given very little attention, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_67'></a>67</span> thinking they were those of the Circle Bar.
&#8220;Them&#8217;s the Circle Cross buildings,&#8221; resumed Norton.
&#8220;They&#8217;re about three miles from the Circle Bar ranchhouse, directly
north through that cottonwood back of the bunkhouse where you tried your gun the
day after you come out here. Down below there&#8211;where you see them two big
cottonwood trees&#8211;is &#8216;Big Elk&#8217; crossin&#8217;. There&#8217;s another
somethin&#8217; like it back up the crick a ways, on the other side of the
ranchhouse, called the &#8216;Narrows.&#8217;&#8221; He laughed grimly. &#8220;But we
don&#8217;t use them crossins&#8217; much&#8211;they&#8217;re dead lines;
generally you&#8217;ll find there&#8217;s a Circle Cross man or so hangin&#8217;
around them&#8211;with a rifle. So it don&#8217;t pay to go monkeyin&#8217;
around there unless you&#8217;ve got pressin&#8217; business.&#8221;</p>

<p>He made a grimace. &#8220;It&#8217;s my opinion that a good many Circle Bar
cattle have crossed the crick in them two places&#8211;never to come
back.&#8221; He swept a hand up the river, indicating the sentinel like buttes
that frowned above the bed of the stream. &#8220;The crick is pretty
shallow,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;but Big Elk an&#8217; the Narrows are the
only two places where a man can cross in safety&#8211;if we consider that there
wouldn&#8217;t be any Circle Cross man hangin&#8217; around them two places. But
there ain&#8217;t no other place to cross an&#8217; so we don&#8217;t go on the
other side much.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned to Hollis, looking at him with a <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_68'></a>68</span> quaint smile. &#8220;From here you can see everything
that amounts to anything in this section&#8211;which ain&#8217;t a heap. Of
course over there are some mountains&#8211;where we was a few days ago
lookin&#8217; up the boys&#8221;&#8211;he pointed to some serrated peaks that
rose somberly in the southwestern distance&#8211;&#8220;but as you saw there
ain&#8217;t much to them except rocks an&#8217; lava beds. There&#8217;s some
hills there&#8221;&#8211;pointing to the south&#8211;&#8220;but there
ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; to see in them. They look a heap better from here than
they do when you get close to them. That&#8217;s the way with lots of things,
ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis smiled. &#8220;I like it,&#8221; he said quietly, &#8220;much better
than I did when I came.&#8221; He turned to Norton with a whimsical smile.
&#8220;I suppose it will strike you as peculiar, but I&#8217;ve got a notion
that I would like to ride around a while alone. I don&#8217;t mean that I
don&#8217;t like your company, for I do. But the notion has just struck
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Norton laughed indulgently. &#8220;I reckon I won&#8217;t consider that
you&#8217;re trying to slight me,&#8221; he returned. &#8220;I know exactly how
you feel; that sort of thing comes over everybody who comes to this
country&#8211;sooner or later. Generally it&#8217;s later, when a man has got
used to the silence an&#8217; the bigness an&#8217; so on. But in your <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span> case it&#8217;s sooner.
You&#8217;ll have to have it out with yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice grew serious. &#8220;But don&#8217;t go ridin&#8217; too far.
An&#8217; keep away from the river trail.&#8221;</p>

<p>In spite of his ready acquiescence he sat for some time on his pony, watching
Hollis as the latter urged his pony along the ridge. Just before Hollis
disappeared down the slope of the ridge he turned and waved a hand to Norton,
and the latter, with a grim, admiring smile, wheeled his pony and loped it over
the back trail.</p>

<p>Once down the slope of the ridge Hollis urged his pony out into the level of
the basin, through some deep saccatone grass, keeping well away from the river
trail as advised by the range boss.</p>

<p>In spite of his serious thoughts Hollis had not been dismayed over the
prospect of remaining at the Circle Bar to fight Dunlavey and his crew. He
rather loved a fight; the thought of clashing with an opposing force had always
filled him with a sensation of indefinable exultation. He reveled in the
primitive passions. He had been endowed by nature with those mental and physical
qualities that combine to produce the perfect fighter. He was six feet of brawn
and muscle; not an ounce of superfluous flesh encumbered him&#8211;he had been
hammered and hardened into a state of physical perfection by several years of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span> athletic training,
sensible living, and good, hard, healthy labor. Circumstances had not permitted
him to live a life of ease. The trouble between his parents&#8211;which had
always been much of a mystery to him&#8211;had forced him at a tender age to go
out into the world and fight for existence. It had toughened him; it had trained
his mind through experience; it had given him poise, persistence,
tenacity&#8211;those rare mental qualities without which man seldom rises above
mediocrity.</p>

<p>Before leaving Dry Bottom to come to the Circle Bar he had telegraphed his
mother that he would be forced to remain indefinitely in the West, and the
sending of this telegram had committed him irrevocably to his sacrifice. He knew
that when his mother received a letter from him explaining the nature of the
work that required his presence in Dry Bottom she would approve his course. At
least he was certain that she would not advise surrendering.</p>

<p>After riding for more than an hour he came to a shallow draw and urged his
pony through the deep sand of its center. On the other side of the draw the
country became suddenly rocky; great boulders were strewn indiscriminately
about, as though some giant hand had distributed them carelessly, without regard
to their final resting place. A lava bed, looming gray and dead under <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span> a barren rock hill, caught
his attention, and he drew his pony to a halt and sat quietly in the saddle
examining it. From the lava bed his gaze went to a weird mineral shape that rose
in the distance&#8211;an inverted cone that seemed perfectly balanced on its
narrowest point. He studied this long without moving, struck with the miraculous
stability of the thing; it seemed that a slight touch would send it tumbling
down.</p>

<p>He realized that he had stumbled upon a spot that would have provided
pleasure to a geological student. To him it was merely a source of wonder and
awe. Some mighty upheaval of nature had created this, and he continued to gaze
at it, his mind full of conjecture.</p>

<p>To his right rose a precipitous rock wall surmounted by a fringe of thick
shrubbery. On the left was another wall, perpendicular, flat on its top and
stretching away into the distance, forming a grass plateau. Directly in front of
him was a narrow canyon through which he could see a plain that stretched away
into the unknown distance.</p>

<p>It was a magnificent country; he did not now regret his decision to remain
here. He pulled out his watch, noting that its hands pointed to ten, and
realized that he must be off if he expected to reach the Circle Bar by noon.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>He sat erect in
the saddle, about to wheel his pony toward the draw through which he had
entered, when he heard a sharp sound. Startled, he glanced swiftly to his right,
searching the immediate vicinity for the agency which had created sound in this
vast silence. He stiffened slowly in the saddle, his face gradually paling. Not
over a hundred feet from him, partly concealed by a big boulder, stood a man
with a rifle, the muzzle of the weapon trained fairly on him.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span><a id='link_5'></a>CHAPTER V<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE GIRL OF DRY BOTTOM</span></h2>

<p>Hollis was not frightened, though he was in a position that might have
aroused fear or apprehension in any man&#8217;s mind. He was alone, the man had
him covered with the rifle, and assuredly this was one of Dunlavey&#8217;s
hirelings.</p>

<p>Hollis glanced swiftly around. Certain signs&#8211;some shrubbery that he saw
through the canyon, a bald butte or two rising in the distance&#8211;told him
that he was near the river. And Norton had told him to keep away from the river
trail. In his eagerness to explore the country he had forgotten all about
Norton&#8217;s warning.</p>

<p>The prospect was not a hopeful one, yet Hollis could not have admitted to
feeling any alarm. He realized that had the man intended any immediate harm he
would have shot him down long before this&#8211;while he had sat motionless in
the saddle inspecting the place. Concerning the man&#8217;s intentions he could
only speculate, but assuredly they were not peaceful.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>For a little time
the man remained motionless and Hollis sat quiet, looking at him. The weapon had
not moved; its muzzle still menaced him and he watched it closely, wondering
whether the man would give him any warning when about to pull the trigger.</p>

<p>Many minutes dragged and the man did not move. A slow anger began to steal
over Hollis; the man&#8217;s inaction grated on his nerves.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; he challenged sharply. &#8220;What do you
want?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no answer. Hollis could see only the man&#8217;s head and shoulders
projecting above the boulder, and the rifle&#8211;steady and
level&#8211;menacing him. With an exclamation of rage and disdain he seized the
bridle rein and pulled sharply on it, swinging the pony&#8217;s head around. The
rifle crashed venomously; Hollis felt the right sleeve of his shirt flutter, and
he pulled the pony abruptly up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just to show you!&#8221; came the man&#8217;s voice, mockingly.
&#8220;If you move again until I give the word you won&#8217;t know where
you&#8217;ve been hit!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis was satisfied&#8211;the man undoubtedly meant business. He settled
back into the saddle and looked down at his shirt sleeve. The bullet had passed
very close to the arm. If the man <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_75'></a>75</span> had meant the bullet for that particular spot he was
a deadly marksman. In the face of such marvelous shooting Hollis did not care to
experiment further. But his anger had not yet abated.</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt you are enjoying yourself!&#8221; he said with bitter
sarcasm. &#8220;But the pleasure is all yours. I am not enjoying myself a bit, I
assure you. And I don&#8217;t like the idea of being a target for you to shoot
at!&#8221;</p>

<p>A laugh came back to Hollis&#8211;a strange, unnatural, sardonic cackle that,
in spite of his self-control, caused his flesh to creep. And then the
man&#8217;s voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you don&#8217;t like it. I knew that all along. But you&#8217;re
going to stay here for seven weeks while I shoot holes in you!&#8221; He laughed
again, his voice high and shrill, its cackling cadences filling the place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seven weeks in Devil&#8217;s Hollow!&#8221; came the voice again.
&#8220;Seven weeks! Seven weeks!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis felt his heart thumping heavily against his ribs, while a sinking
sensation in the pit of his stomach told him that his courage was touched. He
realized now why the man had not shot him down immediately. He was a maniac!</p>

<p>For a few terrible seconds Hollis sat in the saddle while the world reeled
around him; while the rocks and cliffs danced fantastically. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span> Courage he had to be sure;
he had already become resigned to death before the man&#8217;s rifle, but he had
imagined the man to be in full possession of his senses; imagined his death to
have been planned out of the deliberate coolness of reason. Such a death would
have been bad enough, but to meet death at the hands of a man mentally
unbalanced! Somehow it seemed different, seemed horribly unreal&#8211;like a
terrible nightmare.</p>

<p>It was some seconds before he regained control of himself, and then he
steadied himself in the saddle, assuring himself in a burst of bitter, ironic
humor that death at the hands of a crazy man could be no worse than death at the
hands of a rational one.</p>

<p>He looked up again, a defiant smile on his lips, to see that both man and
rifle had disappeared. In a flash he saw his chance and took advantage of it. In
an instant he was off his pony; in another he was behind a convenient rock,
breathing easier, his senses alert. For some little time he remained in the
shelter of the rock, awaiting the other man&#8217;s movements. He did not doubt
that acting upon some freakish impulse, the man had left his boulder and was
even now stalking him from some other direction. He peered carefully about him.
He had no thought of shooting the man&#8211;that would be murder, for the man
was not <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span> mentally
responsible for his actions. His efforts must be centered solely upon some plan
for saving his own life.</p>

<p>To do this he realized that he must be careful. In view of the man&#8217;s
unerring marksmanship it would be certain death for him to expose himself for an
instant. But he must take some chances. Convinced of this he peered around the
edge of his rock, taking a flashing glance around him. The man was nowhere to be
seen. Hollis waited some little time and then taking another glance and not
seeing the man, rose slowly to his feet and crouched. Then, filled with a
sudden, reckless impulse, he sprang for another rock a dozen feet distant,
expecting each instant to hear the crash of the man&#8217;s rifle. But he
succeeded in gaining the shelter of the other rock intact. Evidently the man was
looking for him in some other direction.</p>

<p>Emboldened with his success he grimly determined on advancing to another rock
some twenty or thirty feet farther on. As in the first instance he succeeded in
gaining it in safety. His maneuvering had been circuitous, bringing him into a
position from which he could see partly behind the rock where the man had been
concealed.</p>

<p>And now, having gained the second rock in <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_78'></a>78</span> safety, Hollis decided to take no more chances.
Sooner or later, he was convinced, the man was sure to see him as he jumped. He
did not like the picture that his imagination conjured up. Therefore his actions
were now marked with more caution. It took him a long time to gain a position
where he could peer over the upper edge of the rock behind which he was
concealed. But he gained it finally and then dropped back with an exclamation of
surprise. He had caught a glimpse of the man. He was lying face upward behind
the boulder, his arms outstretched, his rifle lying in the dust near him.</p>

<p>Hollis was tempted to make a run for his pony, mount, and race out of the
hollow. But a second thought restrained him. He had considered the man&#8217;s
action merely a ruse, but why should he attempt it after he had once had an
opportunity to make use of his rifle? Still for an instant Hollis hesitated, for
he knew there was no rule by which a maniac&#8217;s actions might be judged.
Then with a grim laugh he sprang over the few feet that separated him from the
man, approaching him carefully, still slightly doubtful.</p>

<p>But the man was not shamming; Hollis could see that when he had approached
close enough to see his face. It bore a curious pallor, his eyes were wide open
and staring, and some foam <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_79'></a>79</span> flecked his lips. Evidently he had been overcome by a
paroxysm of his malady at about the moment Hollis had discovered it.</p>

<p>Hollis stepped back and heaved a sigh of relief. Then he stepped over to
where the man&#8217;s rifle lay, taking it up and removing the cartridges.
Returning to the man he removed the cartridges from his belt and drew his
six-shooter from its holster, determined that when the man recovered from his
stupor there would be no danger of a recurrence of the previous incident. Then
he leaned against the boulder to await the man&#8217;s recovery.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, while he still watched the man, he heard a clatter of
hoofs. Determined not to be taken by surprise again he drew his own six-shooter
and peered cautiously around the edge of the boulder. What he saw caused him to
jam the weapon back into its holster very hurriedly. Then he stepped out of his
concealment with a red, embarrassed face to greet a young woman whose expression
of doubt and fear was instantly replaced by one of pleasure and recognition as
she caught sight of him. It was the girl of Dry Bottom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Is it you? I was afraid&#8213;&#8221; And
then she saw the man and was off her pony in a flash and at his head, supporting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span> it and pouring
something down his throat from a bottle.</p>

<p>She rose presently, embarrassment crimsoning her face. Hollis saw her lips
quiver when she turned and spoke to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;He will be all right&#8211;now,&#8221; she said, facing Hollis, her
eyes drooping as though ashamed to meet his. &#8220;He has had another attack of
his&#8211;his trouble.&#8221; She looked suddenly up at Hollis, bravely trying
to repress her emotion&#8211;but with little success.</p>

<p>&#8220;You heard what he&#8211;Big Bill Dunlavey&#8211;said about my
brother?&#8221; she questioned, her eyes full and moist. Hollis nodded and she
continued rapidly, her voice quavering: &#8220;Well, he told the truth.&#8221;
Her voice trailed away into a pitiful wail, and she stepped over and leaned
against the boulder, sobbing quietly into her hands. &#8220;That&#8217;s why it
hurts so,&#8221; she added.</p>

<p>Hollis yielded to a sudden wave of sympathy. He stood close to her, aware of
his inability to cope with this strange situation. She looked so small, so out
of place, he felt that whatever he did or said would not help matters. What he
did say, however, assisted in restoring her composure.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad I slugged him!&#8221; he said heatedly.</p>

<p>She turned suddenly to him, her eyes flashing spiritedly through the moisture
in them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>&#8220;Oh, it was
great!&#8221; she declared, her hands clenching at the recollection. &#8220;I
could have shaken hands with you&#8211;with the hand that struck him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis smiled whimsically. &#8220;I&#8217;ve still got the hand,&#8221; he
said significantly, extending it toward her&#8211;&#8220;if you have not
reconsidered.&#8221; He laughed as she took it and pressed it firmly. &#8220;I
rather think that we&#8217;ve both got a shake coming on that,&#8221; he added.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t understand then about your brother or I would have added a
few extra pounds to that punch.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her face clouded as he mentioned her brother. &#8220;Poor Ed,&#8221; she said
in a low voice. She went over to the man, leaning over him and smoothing back
the hair from his forehead, Hollis looking glumly on, clenching his teeth in
impotent sympathy.</p>

<p>&#8220;These attacks do not come often,&#8221; she volunteered as she again
approached Hollis. &#8220;But they do come,&#8221; she added, her voice
catching. Hollis did not reply, feeling that he had no right to be inquisitive.
But she continued, slightly more at ease and plainly pleased to have some one in
whom she might confide.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ed was injured a year ago through a fall,&#8221; she informed Hollis.
&#8220;He was breaking a wild horse and a saddle girth broke and he fell,
striking on his head. The wound healed, but he has <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span> never been the same. At intervals these
attacks come on and then he is irresponsible&#8211;and dangerous.&#8221; She
shuddered. &#8220;You were watching him,&#8221; she added, looking suddenly at
him; &#8220;did you find him as he is or did he attack you? Frequently when he
has these attacks he comes here to Devil&#8217;s Hollow, explaining that he
expects to find some of Dunlavey&#8217;s men. He doesn&#8217;t like
Dunlavey,&#8221; she added with a flush, &#8220;since Dunlavey&#8213;&#8221; She
hesitated and then went on determinedly&#8211;&#8220;well, since Dunlavey told
him that he wanted to marry me. But Ed says that Dunlavey has a wife in Tucson
and&#8211;well, I wouldn&#8217;t have married him anyway&#8211;the
brute!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; agreed Hollis gravely, trying to repress a thrill of
satisfaction; &#8220;of course you couldn&#8217;t marry him.&#8221; He
understood now the meaning of Dunlavey&#8217;s words to her in Dry Bottom.
&#8220;If you wasn&#8217;t such a damn prude,&#8221; he had said. He looked at
the girl with a sudden, grim smile. &#8220;He said something about running you
and your brother out of the country,&#8221; he said; &#8220;of course you
won&#8217;t allow him to do that?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s slight figure stiffened. &#8220;I would like to see him try
it!&#8221; she declared defiantly.</p>

<p>Hollis grinned. &#8220;That&#8217;s the stuff!&#8221; he <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span> sympathized. &#8220;I rather think that
Dunlavey is something of a bluffer&#8211;that folks in this country have allowed
him to have his own way too much.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head doubtfully. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that,&#8221;
she returned. Then she smiled. &#8220;You are the new owner of the Circle Bar,
aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis startled, looking at her with a surprised smile. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he
returned, &#8220;I am the new owner. But how did you know it? I haven&#8217;t
told anyone here except Neil Norton and Judge Graney. Have Norton and the Judge
been talking?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They haven&#8217;t talked to me,&#8221; she assured him with a demure
smile. &#8220;You see,&#8221; she added, &#8220;you were a stranger in Dry
Bottom, and after you left the Fashion you went right down to the court house. I
knew Judge Graney had been your father&#8217;s friend. And then I saw Neil
Norton coming into town with the buckboard.&#8221; She laughed. &#8220;You see,
it wasn&#8217;t very hard to add two and two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, no,&#8221; Hollis agreed, &#8220;it wasn&#8217;t. But how did you
happen to see me go down to the court house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I watched you!&#8221; she returned. And then suddenly aware of
her mistake in admitting <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_84'></a>84</span> that she had felt an interest in him at their first
meeting, she lowered her gaze in confusion and stood, kicking with her booted
toe into a hummock, her face suddenly very red.</p>

<p>The situation might have been embarrassing for her had not her brother
created a diversion by suddenly sighing and struggling to sit up. The girl was
at his side in an instant, assisting him. The young man&#8217;s bewilderment was
pitiful. He sat silent for a full minute, gazing first at his sister and then at
Hollis, and finally at his surroundings. Then, when a rational gleam had come
into his eyes he bowed his head, a blush of shame sweeping over his face and
neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect I&#8217;ve been at it again,&#8221; he muttered, without
looking up.</p>

<p>The girl leaned over him, reassuring him, patting his face lovingly, letting
him know by all a woman&#8217;s arts of the sympathy and love she bore for him.
Hollis watched her with a grim, satisfied smile. If he had had a sister he would
have hoped that she would be like her. He stepped forward and seized the young
man by the arm, helping him to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right now,&#8221; he assured him; &#8220;there has been no
harm done.&#8221;</p>

<p>Standing, the young man favored Hollis with a careful inspection. He flushed
again. &#8220;You&#8217;re <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_85'></a>85</span> the man that rode through the draw,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I saw you and thought you were one of Dunlavey&#8217;s men. I shot at you
once, and was going to shoot again, but something cracked in my head. I hope I
didn&#8217;t hit you.&#8221; Embarrassment again seized him; his eyes drooped.
&#8220;Of course you are not one of Dunlavey&#8217;s men,&#8221; he added,
&#8220;or you wouldn&#8217;t be here, talking to sis. No friend of
Dunlavey&#8217;s could do that.&#8221; He looked at the girl with a tender
smile. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;d do if it wasn&#8217;t for
her,&#8221; he added, speaking to Hollis. &#8220;But I expect it&#8217;s a good
thing that I&#8217;m not crazy all the time.&#8221; He looked searchingly at
Hollis. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen you before,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Who are
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Kent Hollis.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man&#8217;s eyes lighted. &#8220;Not Jim Hollis&#8217;s son?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>Hollis nodded. The young man&#8217;s face revealed genuine pleasure.
&#8220;You going to stay in this here country?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to run the Circle Bar,&#8221; returned Hollis slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bully!&#8221; declared the young man. &#8220;There&#8217;s some folks
around here said you wouldn&#8217;t have nerve enough to stay.&#8221; He made a
wry face. &#8220;But I reckon you&#8217;ve got nerve or you&#8217;d have hit the
breeze when I started to stampede.&#8221; He <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_86'></a>86</span> suddenly held out a hand. &#8220;I like you,&#8221;
he said impulsively. &#8220;You and me are going to be friends.
Shake!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis saw a smile of pleasure light up the girl&#8217;s face, which she
tried to conceal by brushing the young man&#8217;s clothing with a gloved hand,
meanwhile keeping him between her and Hollis.</p>

<p>Hollis stood near the boulder, watching them as they prepared to depart, the
girl telling her brother that he would find his pony on the plains beyond the
canyon.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad I didn&#8217;t hit you,&#8221; the young man told Hollis as
he started away with the girl. &#8220;If you are not scared off you might take a
run down to the shack some time&#8211;it&#8217;s just down the creek a
ways.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis hesitated and then, catching the girl&#8217;s glance, he smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t promise when,&#8221; he said, looking at the girl,
&#8220;but you may be sure that I will look you up the first chance I
get.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood beside the boulder until he saw them disappear around the wall of
the canyon. Then with a satisfied grin he walked to his pony, mounted, and was
off through the draw toward the Circle Bar ranchhouse.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span><a id='link_6'></a>CHAPTER VI<br /><span class='h2fs'>HOLLIS RENEWS AN ACQUAINTANCE</span></h2>

<p>Rumor, that mysterious disseminator of news whose tongues are legion,
whispered that the Dry Bottom <i>Kicker</i> was to come to life. Wherefore
curiosity led many of Dry Bottom&#8217;s citizens past the door of the
<i>Kicker</i> office to steal covert glances at the young man whose figure was
bent over the desk inside. Many passed in silence after looking at the young
man&#8211;he did not see them. Others commented gravely or humorously according
to their whim&#8211;the young man did not hear them. Seated at the desk he gave
his attention to the tasks before him&#8211;he was not concerned with rumor; the
curiosity of Dry Bottom&#8217;s citizens did not affect him. Seriously,
methodically, steadily, he worked at his desk, while rumor wagged her tongues
and curiosity lounged past the window.</p>

<p>It was Hollis&#8217;s first visit to the <i>Kicker</i> office; he had come to
work and there was much that he could do. He had found the <i>Kicker</i>
installed in a one story frame building, verging upon dilapidation, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span> unpainted, dingy. The
appearance of its exterior had given Hollis a queer sensation in the pit of the
stomach. He was cheered a little by the businesslike appearance of the interior.
It was not what he had been used to, but he felt that it would answer very well
in this locality, and&#8211;well, he planned to make improvements.</p>

<p>About twenty by forty, he estimated the size of the interior. Originally
there had been only one room. This had been divided into three sections by
partitions. An old, flat-topped desk sat near the front window, a swivel chair
before it. Along the wall above the desk were several rows of shelving with
paste-board boxes and paper piled neatly up. Calendars, posters, and other
specimens of the printer&#8217;s art covered the walls. In the next room was
another desk. Piles of advertising electrotypes, empty forms, and papers filled
the corners. The composing room was in the rear. Everything was in order here;
type cases, stands, forms. There were a proof press, some galley racks, a
printing press, with a forlorn-looking gasolene engine near it. A small
cast-iron stove stood in a corner with its door yawning open, its front
bespattered with tobacco juice. A dilapidated imposing stone ranged along the
rear wall near a door that <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_89'></a>89</span> opened into the sunlight. A man stood before one of
the type cases distributing type. He did not look up at Hollis&#8217;s
entrance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; greeted Hollis.</p>

<p>The man hesitated in his work and looked up. &#8220;Hello,&#8221; he
returned, perfunctorily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose your name is Potter?&#8221; Hollis inquired cordially. Judge
Graney had told him that if he succeeded in finding the compositor he would have
him at the <i>Kicker</i> office this morning. Potter had gone to work without
further orders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the man. He came forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am the new owner of the <i>Kicker</i>,&#8221; Hollis informed him
with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jim Hollis&#8217;s boy?&#8221; inquired Potter, straightening. At
Hollis&#8217;s nod he stepped quickly forward and grasped the hand the latter
offered him, squeezing it tightly. &#8220;Of course you are Jim Hollis&#8217;s
boy!&#8221; he said, finishing his inspection. &#8220;You are the living image
of him!&#8221; He swept his hand around toward the type case. &#8220;I am
working, you see. Judge Graney wrote me last week that you wanted me and I came
as soon as I could. Is it true that the <i>Kicker</i> is going to be a permanent
institution?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The <i>Kicker</i> is here to stay!&#8221; Hollis informed him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>Potter&#8217;s
face lighted with pleasure. &#8220;That&#8217;s bully!&#8221; he said.
&#8220;That&#8217;s bully!&#8221;</p>

<p>He was of medium height, slender, lean faced, with a magnificent head, and a
wealth of brown hair thickly streaked with silver. His thin lips were strong;
his chin, though a trifle weak, was well formed; his eyes slightly bleared, but
revealing, in spite of this defect, unmistakable intelligence. In the first
flashing glance which Hollis had taken at him he had been aware that here was a
person of more than ordinary mental ability and refinement. It was with a pang
of pity that he remembered Judge Graney&#8217;s words to the effect that he was
a good workman&#8211;&#8220;when sober.&#8221; Hollis felt genuinely sorry for
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have had a talk with Judge Graney,&#8221; volunteered Potter.
&#8220;He tells me that you are a newspaper man. Between us we ought to be able
to get out a very respectable paper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will,&#8221; calmly announced Hollis; &#8220;and we&#8217;ll get
the first issue out Saturday. Come in here and we&#8217;ll talk about
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He led the way to the front room and seated himself at the desk, motioning
Potter to another chair. Within the next hour he knew all about the
<i>Kicker</i>. It was a six-column sheet of four pages. The first page was
devoted to local news. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_91'></a>91</span> The second carried some local advertisements,
exchange clippings, and two or three columns of syndicate plate matter. On the
third page two columns were devoted to editorials, one to advertisements, and
three to local news in large type. The fourth, and last page was filled with
more plate matter and a litter of &#8220;foreign&#8221;
advertising&#8211;patent-medicines, soaps, hair-dye.</p>

<p>At the first glance it appeared that the paper must be a paying proposition,
for there were a goodly proportion of advertisements. Yet Hollis had his
suspicions about the advertisements. When he had spoken to Potter about them he
discovered that quite a number of them were what is known to the craft as
&#8220;dead ads&#8221;&#8211;which meant advertisements upon which payment had
ceased and which were carried either for the purpose of filling up the paper or
because it was found cheaper to run them than to set type for the space which
would be left by their absence.</p>

<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t carry any dead ads!&#8221; announced Hollis.</p>

<p>&#8220;Several of these are big merchants,&#8221; said Potter, pointing them
out with inky forefinger; &#8220;though the contracts have run out the
appearance of their ads lends the <i>Kicker</i> a certain moral
support&#8211;the little fellows don&#8217;t know that they are not paid for and
it draws their business.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>&#8220;We
don&#8217;t care for that kind of business,&#8221; smiled Hollis;
&#8220;we&#8217;re going to run a real newspaper. We&#8217;re going to get paid
ads!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; hesitatingly replied Potter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you do,&#8221; laughed Hollis; &#8220;but whether we get
paid ads or not this newspaper is coming out regularly and on time. Furthermore,
we&#8217;re going to cut down on this plate stuff; we don&#8217;t want a paper
filled with stale articles on snakes, antedated ocean disasters, Egyptian
monoliths, and the latest style in opera hats. We&#8217;ll fill the paper with
local news&#8211;we&#8217;ll ginger things up a little. You are pretty well
acquainted here&#8211;I&#8217;ll leave the local items to you. What town near
here compares with Dry Bottom in size?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Lazette,&#8221; returned Potter; &#8220;over in Colfax
County.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How far from here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eighty miles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Got a newspaper?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; the <i>Eagle</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bully! Step on the <i>Eagle&#8217;s</i> toes. Make the <i>Eagle</i>
scream. Get into an argument with it about something&#8211;anything. Tell
Lazette that as a town it&#8217;s forty miles behind Dry Bottom. That will stir
up public spirit and boom our subscription list. You see, Potter, civic pride is
a <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span> big asset to a
newspaper. We&#8217;ll start a row right off the reel. Furthermore, we&#8217;re
going to have some telegraph news. I&#8217;ll make arrangements for that
to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis&#8217;s enthusiasm was infectious; a flash of spirit lighted up
Potter&#8217;s eyes as he rose from his chair. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to set up
the head for the first page,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Probably you&#8217;ll want a
slogan; that sort of thing is the style out here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have one,&#8221; returned Hollis briskly. &#8220;Set this
in triple leads: <i>&#8216;We Herald the Coming of the Law! The Kicker is Here to
Stay!&#8217;</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; declared Potter. He went into the composing room and
Hollis saw his fine old head bent over a type case. Hollis turned to his
desk.</p>

<p>He sat there long, his tall, lithe body slack, grim, serious lines in his
lean face. He had thought of his conversation with Judge Graney concerning
ambition&#8211;his ambition, the picture upon which his mind had dwelt many
times. A little frame printing office in the West was not one of its features.
He sighed with resignation and began methodically to look over the papers in the
desk, finding many things to interest him. He discovered that in spite of his
father&#8217;s one great fault he had been a methodical man. He smiled
regretfully, wishing that he might have been able to have seen more of him.
Among the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span> papers he
hoped to find a personal note&#8211;a word&#8211;from his father. He found
nothing of that character.</p>

<p>After a time he took up a pen and began to write. Long ago he had decided
that in the first issue of the paper he would attack the Cattlemen&#8217;s
Association. Judge Graney had ridden out to the Circle Bar on the previous
Saturday afternoon, remaining over Sunday, and accompanying Hollis on the return
trip Monday morning.</p>

<p>While at the ranch the Judge had spent much of his time in communicating to
Hollis his views of the situation in Union County and in acquainting him with
the elder Hollis&#8217;s intentions regarding the newspaper. Hollis had made
some inquiries on his own account, with the result that when he reached the
<i>Kicker</i> office this morning he felt that he had acquired a good and
sufficient knowledge of the situation.</p>

<p>Looking over the old copy of the <i>Kicker</i> he studied some of the
advertisements. Evidently some Dry Bottom merchants had been brave enough to
antagonize Dunlavey by advertising in the <i>Kicker</i>. With this copy of the
<i>Kicker</i> in hand Hollis rose from his desk, told Potter he was going out,
and proceeded to visit some of the merchants whose advertisements appeared in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span> the paper, hoping
that their bravery still abided with them. He made a good solicitor. Some of the
merchants flatly refused, saying they did not care to risk Dunlavey&#8217;s
anger. Others demurred, confidentially announcing that they had never considered
the paper seriously and that there was really no good in advertising in Dry
Bottom anyway&#8211;the town wasn&#8217;t big enough. Half a dozen listened
quietly while he told them that the <i>Kicker</i> was in Dry Bottom to stay and
then smiled and told him to run their advertisements. They rather admired his
&#8220;nerve&#8221; and were not afraid of Dunlavey.</p>

<p>At noon Hollis stepped into a restaurant called the Alhambra. While he ate he
was critically inspected; the Alhambra swarmed with customers, and the
proprietor quietly informed him that he was a &#8220;drawin&#8217; card&#8221;
and hoped he&#8217;d &#8220;grub&#8221; there regularly. In return for his
promise to do so Hollis secured his advertisement.</p>

<p>Leaving the Alhambra he returned to the <i>Kicker</i> office, seating himself
again at his desk. The sun came slantwise through the window full upon him; the
heat was oppressive; the flint-like alkali dust sifted through the crevices in
the building and settled over everything in the room; myriad flies droned in the
white sunlight before the open door. He heard nothing, felt nothing, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span> saw nothing&#8211;for his
thoughts were miles away, in an upper story of a big office building in the East
from whose windows he even now looked down upon a bustling city.</p>

<p>Life would be so different here. He heard a sound behind him and turned.
Dunlavey was standing just inside the door, his great arms folded over his
chest. He had been watching Hollis, his eyes narrowed with a cynically humorous
expression.</p>

<p>Hollis knew that by this time Dunlavey must have discovered his identity. He
swung slowly around in his chair, his face wearing an expression of whimsical
amusement as he greeted his victim of a few days previous.</p>

<p>&#8220;Welcome to the <i>Kicker</i> office,&#8221; he said quietly.</p>

<p>Dunlavey did not move. Evidently he had expected another sort of greeting and
was slightly puzzled over Hollis&#8217;s manner. He remained motionless and
Hollis had an opportunity to study him carefully and thoroughly. His conclusions
were brief and comprehensive. They were expressed tersely to himself as he
waited for Dunlavey to speak: &#8220;A trickster and a
cheat&#8211;dangerous.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dunlavey&#8217;s eyes flashed metallically for an instant, but immediately
the humorous cynicism came into them again. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_97'></a>97</span> &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you mean all of
that,&#8221; he said evenly.</p>

<p>Hollis laughed. &#8220;I am not in the habit of saying things that I do not
mean,&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;I am here to do business and I am ready to
talk to anybody who wants to do business with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dunlavey&#8217;s hands fell to his sides and were shoved into his capacious
trousers&#8217; pockets. &#8220;Right,&#8221; he said tersely:
&#8220;that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m here for&#8211;to talk business.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pulled a chair over close to Hollis and seated himself in it, moving
deliberately, a certain grim reserve in his manner. Hollis watched him,
marveling at his self-control. He reflected that it required will power of a
rare sort to repress or conceal the rage which he surely must feel over his
humiliation of two weeks before. That Dunlavey was able to so mask his feelings
convinced Hollis that he had to deal with a man of extraordinary character.</p>

<p>&#8220;I recollect meeting you the other day,&#8221; said Dunlavey after he
had become seated. He smiled with his lips, his eyes glittering again.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll say that we got acquainted then. There ain&#8217;t no need for
us to shake hands now.&#8221; He showed his teeth in a mirthless grin. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t know you then, but I know you now. You&#8217;re Jim Hollis&#8217;s
boy.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>Hollis nodded.
Dunlavey continued evenly: &#8220;Your father and me wasn&#8217;t what you might
call bosom friends. I reckon Judge Graney has told you that&#8211;if he
ain&#8217;t you&#8217;ve heard it from some one else. It don&#8217;t make any
difference. So there won&#8217;t be any misunderstanding I&#8217;ll tell you
that I ain&#8217;t figgering on you and me hitching up to the mutual friendship
wagon either. I might say that we wasn&#8217;t introduced right.&#8221; He
grinned evilly. &#8220;But I ain&#8217;t letting what happened interfere with
the business that&#8217;s brought me here to-day. I&#8217;ve heard that
you&#8217;re intending to start the <i>Kicker</i> again; that you&#8217;re
figgering on staying here and running the Circle Bar. What I&#8217;m here for is
to buy you out. I&#8217;m offering you fifteen thousand dollars for the Circle
Bar and this damn newspaper.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dunlavey had lost a little of the composure which had characterized his
actions since entering the office and the last words of his speech had writhed
venomously through his lips.</p>

<p>Hollis&#8217;s face betrayed absolutely no emotion. Though Dunlavey&#8217;s
visit to the <i>Kicker</i> office had surprised him he was not surprised at his
offer for the ranch and the newspaper, for according to Judge Graney he had made
some such offer to the elder Hollis. Coming now, with an addition of five
thousand dollars, Dunlavey&#8217;s offer <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_99'></a>99</span> seemed to advertise his reluctance to continue the
war that he had waged. Hollis appreciated the situation. If Dunlavey were to buy
him off now there would come an end to the warfare that had already been an
expensive one for the interests represented by Dunlavey. Likewise, the
acceptance of the offer would give Hollis an opportunity to withdraw gracefully.
Dunlavey had placed the issue squarely before him. The young man held his future
in his hands and he did not reply at once.</p>

<p>He sat silent for a few moments, studying the coarse, brutal face of the man
seated before him, noting that his under jaw had come forward slightly, and that
the cold, hard glitter had come again in his eyes. However, Hollis&#8217;s
silence meant nothing beyond the fact that he was going slowly over the history
of the fight between his father and the man who sat there representing the
interests which had begun the war. He had no thought of surrendering&#8211;that
would be dishonorable. He was merely revolving the situation in his mind,
considering how best to word his refusal. He did not want to appear belligerent;
he did not want to precipitate war. But he did want Dunlavey to know that he
purposed to have his rights; he wanted Dunlavey to know that he could not be
frightened into surrendering them. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_100'></a>100</span> He clasped one hand over his knee and leaned back
in his chair, his gaze meeting Dunlavey&#8217;s steadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dunlavey,&#8221; he said quietly, &#8220;what is the actual value of
the Circle Bar ranch?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dunlavey smiled blandly. &#8220;You couldn&#8217;t find any man around these
parts to take it at any price,&#8221; he returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; questioned Hollis.</p>

<p>Dunlavey grinned mysteriously. &#8220;I reckon you know why,&#8221; he
returned; &#8220;you&#8217;re pretty much of a tenderfoot, but I reckon Judge
Graney has put you wise to the situation. There ain&#8217;t nobody wants to buy
the Circle Bar except me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; persisted Hollis.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon you know that too,&#8221; laughed Dunlavey. &#8220;It
ain&#8217;t no secret. The Cattlemen&#8217;s Association is running things in
this here county and it ain&#8217;t wanting anyone to buy the Circle Bar except
me. And nobody is fool enough to antagonize the Association. That&#8217;s the
why, if you want to know real bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are frank about it at any rate,&#8221; conceded Hollis smiling
slightly. &#8220;But that doesn&#8217;t get us anywhere. What I am trying to get
at is this: what would the Circle Bar bring in cash if the Cattlemen&#8217;s
Association ceased to be a factor in the county?&#8221; <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span> Dunlavey grinned broadly. &#8220;For a
tenderfoot you&#8217;re real amusing,&#8221; he derided. &#8220;There
ain&#8217;t nobody out here crazy enough to think that the Cattlemen&#8217;s
Association will ever be put out of business!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis&#8217;s lips curled a little, but his gaze was still steady.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s evasion, Dunlavey,&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;You
will remember that I asked you what the Circle Bar would bring &#8216;if&#8217; the
Association ceased to be a factor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dunlavey favored Hollis with a perplexed grin. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what
difference that makes,&#8221; he returned. &#8220;We&#8217;re dealing with
what&#8217;s before us now&#8211;we ain&#8217;t considering what might be. But
if you want to know my personal opinion it&#8217;s that the Circle Bar might
bring thirty thousand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Hollis dryly; &#8220;that&#8217;s getting
somewhere. And now we&#8217;ll be able to talk business. We&#8217;ve got thirty
thousand to start with. I am told that when the Association began its war
against my father he was rather prosperous. Usually he rounded up about two
thousand head of cattle. But we&#8217;ll call it a thousand. We&#8217;ll say
that they brought about thirty dollars a head, which would make an income of
thirty thousand dollars a year, gross. We&#8217;ll deduct fifty per cent <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span> for operating expenses,
losses, and so on. That would leave about fifteen thousand. You&#8217;ve been
fighting the Circle Bar for several years. We&#8217;ll call it five. Five times
fifteen thousand is seventy-five thousand. That represents the sum which my
father would have made from the Circle Bar if you had not fought him. Add to
that the thirty thousand which you admit would be a fair figure for the ranch if
the Association were eliminated as a factor, and we have a total of one hundred
and five thousand dollars.&#8221; He smiled and leaned a little farther back in
his chair, narrowing his eyes at Dunlavey. &#8220;Now we have reached a point
where we can get somewhere. I&#8217;ll take one hundred thousand dollars for the
Circle Bar.&#8221;</p>

<p>The calm announcement had no effect upon Dunlavey except to cause him to grin
derisively.</p>

<p>&#8220;For a tenderfoot you&#8217;re pretty slick,&#8221; he allowed, his
teeth showing. &#8220;You&#8217;ve figgered it out so that it sounds right
reasonable. But you&#8217;ve forgot one thing. The Cattlemen&#8217;s Association
ain&#8217;t eliminated. It says that the Circle Bar is worth fifteen thousand.
You&#8217;ll take that or&#8213;&#8221; He smiled grimly, holding back the
threat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I know what you mean,&#8221; said Hollis quietly, without
changing color. &#8220;You mean <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_103'></a>103</span> that the Cattlemen&#8217;s Association will
continue its fight and eventually ruin the Circle Bar. Perhaps it will&#8211;no
man can tell what lies in the future. But I can tell you this: you can&#8217;t
retard progress.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; said Dunlavey with an irritating drawl.</p>

<p>Hollis smiled composedly. He spoke without bitterness.
&#8220;Dunlavey,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to tell you something
which you perhaps know but will not admit. Your Association has been successful
in pulling the strings which make the politicians at Washington jump to do your
bidding. I don&#8217;t accuse you of buying them, but in any event they have
greased the ways over which your Association has slipped to power. And now you
think that the impetus you have gained will carry you along indefinitely. It
won&#8217;t. Everything in this world runs its natural course and when it does
there comes an end.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you were endowed with the average foresight you would be able to
see that things cannot always go on the way they have. The law must come. It is
inevitable. Its coming will be facilitated by such organizations as the
Cattlemen&#8217;s Association and by such men as you. Back in the East the
forces of Good and Bad are battling. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_104'></a>104</span> The forces of Good will be victorious. The
government at Washington is familiar with the conditions that exist here and
sooner or later will be compelled to act. When it does the small cattle owner
will receive protection.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re holding tight till the law comes,&#8221; sneered Dunlavey;
&#8220;which won&#8217;t be soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps not,&#8221; admitted Hollis dryly; &#8220;good things come
slowly. Meanwhile, if you don&#8217;t care to accept my figure for the Circle
Bar I shall follow your example and hold tight until the law comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Meaning that you won&#8217;t sell, I suppose?&#8221; sneered
Dunlavey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Meaning just that,&#8221; returned Hollis quietly. &#8220;I am going
to fight you. I have offered the Circle Bar at a fair figure and you have
responded with threats. I wouldn&#8217;t sell to you now if you offered one
hundred and fifty thousand. The Circle Bar is not for sale!&#8221;</p>

<p>Dunlavey had not moved. He sat quiet, leaning a little forward, his hands
resting on his knees, his eyes narrowed to glittering pin-points as he watched
Hollis. When the latter had concluded he leaned back, laughing hoarsely.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do with this damn newspaper?&#8221; he
demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;The newspaper will be used as a weapon <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span> against you,&#8221; returned Hollis.
&#8220;It will kick loud and long against such organizations as the
Cattlemen&#8217;s Association&#8211;against such men as you. Ostensibly the
<i>Kicker</i> will be a Dry Bottom newspaper, but it will appear in every city
in the East; the matter that appears in it will be reprinted in Chicago, in
Washington, in New York&#8211;in fact in every city in which I have a friend
engaged in the newspaper business&#8211;and I have a number. I am going to stir
up sentiment against you. I am going to be the Law&#8217;s advance
agent!&#8221;</p>

<p>Dunlavey rose, his lips curling with contempt. &#8220;You make me
sick!&#8221; he sneered. He turned his back and walked to the door, returning
and standing in front of Hollis, ominously cool and deliberate. &#8220;So
that&#8217;s the how of it?&#8221; he said evenly. &#8220;You&#8217;ve come out
here looking for fight. Well, you&#8217;ll get it&#8211;plenty of it. I owe you
something&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait, Dunlavey,&#8221; Hollis interrupted, without excitement;
&#8220;I want you to understand that there isn&#8217;t anything personal in
this. I am going to fight you because you are a member of the Cattlemen&#8217;s
Association and not because you were my father&#8217;s enemy. I am not afraid of
you. I suspect that you will try to make things decidedly interesting for me
from now on and I <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
suppose I ought to be properly troubled. But I am not. I shall not be surprised
at anything you do. I think that is all. Please close the door when you go
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned to the desk, ignoring Dunlavey. Sitting there, his senses alert, he
heard the door slam. From beyond it came a curse. Silence again reigned in the
office; Hollis was alone with the dust and the heat&#8211;and some very original
thoughts.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span><a id='link_7'></a>CHAPTER VII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE &#8220;KICKER&#8221; BECOMES AN INSTITUTION</span></h2>

<p>It was mid-July&#8211;and hot. The sun shone continually; the nights were
uncomfortable, stifling. The dust was everywhere and grew deeper and lighter as
the days passed. Water grew scarce; cattle suffered, lowing throughout the
night, during the day searching the bogs and water holes for drops of moisture.
Men looked up at the clear, cloudless sky and prayed&#8211;and cursed&#8211;for
rain. The rain did not come. It was one long, continuous nightmare of heat.</p>

<p>The <i>Kicker</i> had appeared four times&#8211;on Saturdays&#8211;on time.
Telegraphic communication with the outside world had been established. Potter
had taken up his residence at the Circle Bar. War had been declared between the
<i>Kicker</i> and the Lazette <i>Eagle</i>. Hollis had written an argumentative
essay on the virtues of Dry Bottom as a town, dwelling upon its superiority over
Lazette. The editor of the <i>Eagle</i> had replied with some bitterness,
setting forth in detail why Dry Bottom did <i>not</i> compare with Lazette. As
the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span> editor of the
<i>Eagle</i> mentioned population and civic spirit in his bill of particulars
the war promised to be of long duration&#8211;questions of superiority between
spirited persons are never settled. And Hollis had succeeded in arousing the
spirit of Dry Bottom&#8217;s citizens. They began to take some interest in the
<i>Kicker</i>. Many subscribed; all read it.</p>

<p>From the &#8220;local&#8221; columns of the paper one might have discovered
that many public and private improvements were contemplated. Among these the
following items were of the greatest interest:</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p>Steps are being taken by the government toward the erection of a fence around
the court house grounds. Judge Graney is contemplating a lawn and flowers. When
these improvements are completed there will be no comparison between our court
house and the dilapidated hovel which disgraces the county seat of Colfax. The
Lazette <i>Eagle</i> please notice.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>William Dunn, the proprietor of the Alhambra eating house, announces that in
the near future he will erect a new sign. Thereafter the Alhambra will be known
as the Alhambra Restaurant. This is a step forward. We have been informed that
there is no restaurant in Lazette. Good boy, Dunn.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>Chet Miller&#8217;s general merchandise store is to be repainted throughout.
Chet is public spirited.</p> </div><!-- block quote -->

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>Everybody of any
importance in Dry Bottom received weekly mention of some sort in the
<i>Kicker</i>. Chet Miller was heard to say that the <i>Kicker</i> was a
&#8220;hummer,&#8221; and no one ascribed his praise of the paper to thanks for
the appearance of his name therein, for all who would have criticized were
silenced by the appearance of their own names.</p>

<p>In the fourth issue of the paper appeared several new advertisements.
Judicious personal mention and lively news locals had aroused public spirit to a
point where it ignored thoughts of Dunlavey&#8217;s displeasure.</p>

<p>Upon the Saturday which had marked the first issue of the <i>Kicker</i> under
Hollis&#8217;s ownership he had employed a circulation manager. That afternoon
on the street near the <i>Kicker</i> office he had almost collided with a red
haired youth of uncertain age who had bounded out through the door of a private
dwelling. In order to keep from knocking the youth over Hollis was forced to
seize him by the arms and literally lift him off his feet. While in the air the
youth&#8217;s face was close to Hollis&#8217;s and both grinned over the
occurrence. When Hollis set the youth down he stood for an instant, looking up
into Hollis&#8217;s face and a grin of amusement overspread his own.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_110'></a>110</span>&#8220;Shucks!&#8221; he said slowly. &#8220;If it
ain&#8217;t the tenderfoot editor!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just who it is,&#8221; returned Hollis with a smile.</p>

<p>The youth grinned as he looked critically at Hollis. &#8220;You gittin&#8217;
out that there paper to-day, mister?&#8221; he questioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right now,&#8221; returned Hollis.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bully!&#8221; exclaimed the youth. He surveyed Hollis with a frank
admiration. &#8220;They said you wouldn&#8217;t have the nerve to do it,&#8221;
he said; &#8220;but, say! I reckon they ain&#8217;t got you sized up
right!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis smiled, remembering that though the paper had been printed it was not
yet distributed. He placed a hand on the youth&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you got nerve enough to pass the <i>Kicker</i> around to the
people of this town?&#8221; he questioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon,&#8221; grinned the youth. &#8220;I was comin&#8217; down to
ast you for the job when you bumped into me. I used to peddle them for your dad.
My name&#8217;s Jiggs Lenehan&#8211;mebbe you&#8217;ve heard of me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis smiled. &#8220;The question of delivering the <i>Kicker</i> was one of
the details that I overlooked,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But fortunately it is
arranged now. Henceforth, Jiggs, you are the <i>Kicker&#8217;s</i> official
circulation manager. Likewise, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_111'></a>111</span> if you care to add to your income, you can help
Potter around the office.&#8221;</p>

<p>So it had been arranged, and Jiggs entered upon his duties with an energy
that left little doubt in his employer&#8217;s mind that he would prove a
valuable addition to the force.</p>

<p>In Hollis&#8217;s &#8220;Salutatory&#8221; to the people of Dry Bottom he had
announced in a quiet, unostentatious paragraph that while he had not come to Dry
Bottom for a free fight, he would permit no one to tread on his toes. His
readers&#8217; comprehension of the metaphor was complete&#8211;as was evidenced
by the warm hand-clasps which he received from citizens who were not in sympathy
with the Dunlavey regime. It surprised him to find how many such there were in
town. He was convinced that all this element needed was a leader and he grimly
determined to step quietly into that position himself.</p>

<p>The second issue of the <i>Kicker</i> was marked by a more aggressive
spirit&#8211;a spirit engendered by the sympathetic reception of the first
issue. In it he stated concisely his views of the situation in Union County,
telling his readers that the best interests of the community demanded that
Dunlavey&#8217;s evil influence be wiped out. This article was headed:
&#8220;Dry Bottom&#8217;s Future,&#8221; and won him many friends.</p>

<p>The third issue contained stronger language, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_112'></a>112</span> and the fourth was energetically aggressive. As he
had decided before the first appearance of the paper, he took a certain number
of copies of each issue, folded them neatly, stamped and addressed them, and
mailed them to a number of newspapers throughout the country whose editors he
knew. He also directed copies to a number of his friends in the East&#8211;to
the president of his college, and last, to the Secretary of the Interior at
Washington, who had formerly resided near him in Boston, and with whom he had a
long acquaintance. There had been a change of administration the fall previous
and he was certain that the new administration would not ignore the situation.
To the Secretary, and also to a number of his friends, he wrote personal
letters, explaining in detail the exact condition of affairs in Union
County.</p>

<p>He had not seen Dunlavey since the day the latter had come to the
<i>Kicker</i> office to negotiate for the purchase of the paper. On several of
his rides to and from the Circle Bar ranch he had seen signs of life at the
Circle Cross; once or twice he thought he saw someone watching him from a hill
on the Circle Cross side of the Rabbit-Ear, but of this he was not quite
certain, for the hill-top was thickly wooded and the distance great.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>He had been
warned by Norton not to ride too often over the same trail lest Dunlavey send
someone to ambush him.</p>

<p>Hollis had laughed at the warning, though thanking Norton for it. He told his
range boss that he did not anticipate any immediate trouble with Dunlavey.</p>

<p>&#8220;It all depends on how Big Bill feels,&#8221; returned Norton with a
grim smile. &#8220;If you&#8217;ve got him mad there&#8217;s no telling. And
there are plenty of places between here and Dry Bottom where a man might be shot
from ambush. And nobody&#8217;d ever know who done it. I wouldn&#8217;t ride the
Dry Bottom trail every day. There&#8217;s the old Coyote trail, that takes you
past the Razor-Back and through Devil&#8217;s Hollow to Little Canyon an&#8217;
along the hills to the other side.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed. &#8220;There&#8217;s only one thing you need to be afraid of if
you take the Coyote trail, an&#8217; that&#8217;s Ed Hazelton. Ed gets spells
when he&#8217;s plum crazy. He&#8217;s Nellie Hazelton&#8217;s brother&#8211;her
that Dunlavey was pesterin&#8217; when you slammed him.&#8221; He laughed again,
significantly. &#8220;Though if Ed knowed you was the man who took his
sister&#8217;s part you wouldn&#8217;t need to be much scared of
him&#8211;I&#8217;ve heard that he&#8217;s got a pretty good memory for his
friends&#8211;even when he&#8217;s off.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>Hollis had not
told Norton of his experience in Devil&#8217;s Hollow, nor did he tell him now.
But he followed his advice about taking the Coyote trail, and the following day
when he made the trip to Dry Bottom he returned that way. About half way between
Dry Bottom and the Circle Bar he came upon a little adobe cabin snuggling an
arroyo through which trickled a small stream of water.</p>

<p>It was an ideal location for a small rancher, and Hollis observed that the
buildings were in order&#8211;evidently Nellie Hazelton and her brother were
provident. He saw some cattle grazing on the edge of a small grass plateau which
began at the slope of the arroyo through which the stream of water ran. A shout
reached his ears as he sat motionless in the saddle looking about him, and he
saw Ed Hazelton on the plateau among the cattle, waving a hand to him. The young
man began to descend the side of the plateau, but before he had fairly started
Nellie Hazelton had come out of the front door of the cabin and stood on the
edge of the small porch, smiling at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you did come, after all?&#8221; was her greeting.</p>

<p>Hollis spurred his pony closer and sat smiling down at her. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t think anything could <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_115'></a>115</span> have stopped me after your invitation,&#8221; he
returned quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she said. The sudden color that came into her face told of
her confusion. It betrayed the fact that she knew he had come because of her.
Her brother&#8217;s invitation in Devil&#8217;s Hollow had been merely formal;
there had been another sort of invitation in her eyes as she and her brother had
left him that day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you get off your horse?&#8221; she said while he still sat
motionless. &#8220;It&#8217;s quite a while before sundown and you have plenty
of time to reach the Circle Bar before dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had determined to discover something of the mystery that surrounded her
and her brother, and so he was off his pony quickly and seating himself in a
chair that she drew out of the cabin for him. By the time her brother had
reached the porch Hollis was stretched comfortably out in the chair and was
answering several timid questions concerning his opinion of the country and his
new responsibilities.</p>

<p>She was glad he liked the country, she said. It was wonderful. In the five
years they had been here they had enjoyed it thoroughly&#8211;that was, of
course, barring the trouble they had had with Dunlavey.</p>

<p>Of their trouble with Dunlavey Hollis would <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_116'></a>116</span> hear much later, he told himself. At present he was
more interested in discovering something about her and her brother, though he
did not wish to appear inquisitive. Therefore his voice was politely casual.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you are not a Westerner?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>She smiled mournfully. &#8220;No,&#8221; she returned; &#8220;we&#8211;Ed and
I&#8211;were raised in Illinois, near Springfield. We came out here five years
ago after&#8211;after mother died.&#8221; Her voice caught. &#8220;Sometimes it
seems terribly lonesome out here,&#8221; she added; &#8220;when I get to
thinking of&#8211;of our other home. But&#8221;&#8211;she smiled bravely through
the sudden moisture that had come into her eyes&#8211;&#8220;since Ed got hurt I
don&#8217;t have much time to think of myself. Poor fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis was silent. He had never had a sister but he could imagine how she
must feel over the misfortune that had come to her brother. It must be a
sacrifice for her to remain in this country, to care for a brother who must be a
great burden to her at times, to fight the solitude, the hardships, to bear with
patience the many inconveniences which are inevitable in a new, unsettled
country. He felt a new admiration for her and a profound sympathy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that you must be a very brave young woman,&#8221; he said
earnestly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_117'></a>117</span>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she returned with a sudden,
illuminating smile. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t hard to be brave. But at times I find
it hard to be patient.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Patience is one of the cardinal virtues,&#8221; declared Hollis,
&#8220;but it takes bravery of a rare sort to remain in this country, surrounded
with the care&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>Her fingers were suddenly over her lips warningly, and he saw Ed Hazelton
nearing the porch.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have him know for the world,&#8221; she said rapidly.
&#8220;It isn&#8217;t a care to look after someone you love.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis smiled grimly at the reproach in her voice and rose to greet her
brother.</p>

<p>The latter seemed to be quite recovered from the attack he had suffered in
Devil&#8217;s Hollow and talked freely and intelligently of affairs in the
country. Hollis found that on the whole he was a well informed young
man&#8211;quiet, modest, and apparently well able to give a good account of
himself in spite of his affliction. He was bitter against Dunlavey and thanked
Hollis warmly for his defense of his sister.</p>

<p>At sundown Hollis departed, telling the Hazeltons that since he was their
neighbor he would not neglect to see them occasionally. As he rode away into the
dusk Nellie Hazelton stood on the porch smilingly waving her hand at him. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span> As he threaded his way
through the rapidly growing darkness he felt an unaccountable satisfaction over
the fact that he had elected to remain in Union County; that henceforth his
fortunes were to be linked with those of a brave young woman who had also
accepted the robes of sacrifice and who was committed to war against their
common enemy&#8211;Dunlavey. Curiously, during the past few days he had felt a
decided change in his attitude toward life. His old ambition was no longer
uppermost in his mind&#8211;it had been crowded out of his existence. In its
place had been erected a new pinnacle of promise. A seat among the mighty was a
worthy goal. Yet the lowly bench of sacrifice was not without its
compensations.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span><a id='link_8'></a>CHAPTER VIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>CONCERNING THE &#8220;SIX-O&#8217;CLOCK&#8221;</span></h2>

<p>On Friday evening previous to the Saturday on which the <i>Kicker</i> was to
be issued for the fifth consecutive time by Hollis, Potter did not ride out to
the Circle Bar. There still remained some type to be set and Potter had declared
his intention of completing the work and staying overnight in town. Hollis had
acquiesced and had departed for the Circle Bar alone.</p>

<p>When he reached Dry Bottom the following morning he found a small crowd of
people in front of the <i>Kicker</i> office. During the night someone had posted
a written notice on the front door, and when Hollis dismounted from his pony
there were perhaps a dozen interested citizens grouped about the door, reading
the notice. There were several of the town&#8217;s merchants and a number of
cowboys&#8211;new arrivals and those who had remained overnight to gamble and
participate in the festivities that were all-night features of the dives. There
were also the usual loafers, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_120'></a>120</span> who constitute an element never absent in any group
of idlers in any street. All, however, gave way before Hollis and allowed him to
reach the door without molestation, though in passing he observed significant
grins on several faces.</p>

<p>The notice was written in a bold, legible hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Hollis:&#8221;&#8211;it read, the prefix
under-scored&#8211;&#8220;The express leaves town this afternoon at six
o&#8217;clock&#8211;goin' east. Better be on it.&#8221;</p>

<p class='tar'>Signed&#8211;&#8220;Y. Z.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis read the notice and then turned and quietly surveyed his watchful,
interested audience. He smiled grimly, seeing several faces which, though
plainly expressing amusement, seemed quietly sympathetic. He felt that these
were wishing him success, though doubting his ability to cope with his enemies.
Other faces were plainly antagonistic in expression. He looked at both for an
instant and then turned again to the notice and producing a pencil printed
boldly on its face the slogan he had devised:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span><i>&#8220;We
Herald the Coming of the Law! The Kicker is Here to Stay!&#8221;</i></p>

<p>And below he indulged in this sarcasm: <i>&#8220;Don&#8217;t hold the express
on my account!&#8221;</i></p>

<p class='tar'>Signed&#8211;&#8220;KENT HOLLIS&#8221;</p>

<p>Leaving his audience to stare after him Hollis pushed open the door of the
office and entered.</p>

<p>He found Potter bending over the imposing table, hard at work on one of the
forms. Three other forms, locked and ready for the press, stood in a corner.
Potter looked up and smiled as his chief entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;See the notice on the door?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of Dunlavey&#8217;s work, I suppose,&#8221; returned Hollis.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, yes. I suppose Dunlavey is back of it. But Yuma tacked the sign
up.&#8221; He smiled soberly as Hollis flashed a grin at him. &#8220;They tried
hard last night to get me to drink. Of course their purpose was to get me drunk
so that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to get the paper out today. I am not going to
tell you how hard I had to fight myself to resist the temptation to drink. But
you can see for yourself that I succeeded. The <i>Kicker</i> will be ready to go
to press in an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>He felt Hollis&#8217;s hand patting his shoulder <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span> approvingly and he continued, a little
hoarsely. &#8220;I took one drink at the Fashion last night after I got through
here. Then I came back and went to sleep. I am a light sleeper and when some
time after midnight I heard a sound at the door I got up and peered out of the
window. I saw Yuma tacking up the notice. I suppose Dunlavey wrote it.&#8221; He
looked at Hollis with a whimsical expression. &#8220;I suppose you are going to
take the express?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tried to get you drunk, did they?&#8221; shaking his head negatively
to Potter&#8217;s question, a smile on his face. &#8220;I can&#8217;t understand
that game,&#8221; he continued, soberly. &#8220;Of course getting you drunk
would have prevented the appearance of the paper on scheduled time. But if they
wanted to do serious damage&#8211;of course I mean to the paper,&#8221; he
apologized with a grim smile, &#8220;why didn&#8217;t they come down
here&#8211;some of them&#8211;during your absence, and smash things up? That
would have made the thing sure for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Potter laughed mirthlessly. &#8220;Of course they could have done
that,&#8221; he said; &#8220;it would have been easy&#8211;will be easy any
time. But it wouldn&#8217;t be artistic, would be coarse in fact. Dunlavey
doesn&#8217;t do things that way. If they smash your stuff, destroy your plant
here, ruin <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span> your
type and press, and so forth, they invite sympathy in your behalf. But if they
prevent the appearance of your paper without having done any damage to your
plant they accomplish something&#8211;they expose you to ridicule. And in this
country ridicule is a potent weapon&#8211;even if it involves nothing more
serious than a drunken printer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis shook Potter&#8217;s hand in silence. He had expected violence from
Dunlavey; long before this he had expected him to show his hand, to attempt some
covert and damaging action. And he had been prepared to fight to get the
<i>Kicker</i> out. He had not expected subtlety from Dunlavey.</p>

<p>He went to his desk and sat in the chair, looking out through the window at
the crowd that still lingered in front of the office. Most of the faces wore
grins. Plainly they were amused, but Hollis saw that the amusement was of a grim
sort. They appreciated the situation and enjoyed its humor but felt the tragedy
behind it. Probably most of them were acquainted with Dunlavey&#8217;s methods;
some of them probably knew of the attempt that had been made to incapacitate
Potter. Certainly those of them that did know had seen the failure of the
attempt and were now speculating upon Dunlavey&#8217;s next <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span> move. Looking out of the window Hollis
felt that some of his audience must be wondering whether the editor of the
<i>Kicker</i> would pay any attention to the notice on the door. Would he
scare?</p>

<p>Hollis had already decided that he would not &#8220;scare.&#8221; He grinned
at several of the men who watched him and then turned and instructed Potter to
take down a column of type on the first page of the paper to make room for an
article that he intended to write. Then he seized a pen and wrote a red hot
defiance directed at the authors of the notice, which Potter set up under the
heading:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why the Editor of the <i>Kicker</i> Won&#8217;t Take the
Express.&#8221;</p>

<p>In clear, terse language he told his audience his reasons. This was America;
he was an American, and he didn&#8217;t purpose to allow the Cattlemen&#8217;s
Association&#8211;or any other association, gang, or individual&#8211;to dictate
the policy of his paper or influence his private actions. Least of all did he
purpose to allow anyone to &#8220;run him out of town.&#8221; He printed the
notice entire, adding his answer, assuring readers that he was sending copies of
the <i>Kicker</i> to every newspaper in the East and that notices such as had
been affixed to his door would react against the authors. He ended with the
prophecy that <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span> the
law would come into Union County and that meanwhile the <i>Kicker</i> purposed
to fight.</p>

<p>At noon Hollis took the usual number of copies to the station and mailed
them. Walking down the street on his return from the station he attracted much
attention. Men stood in the open doorways of saloons watching him, a number
openly jeered; others sent subtle jibes after him. Still others were silent,
their faces expressing amusement.</p>

<p>But he looked at none of them. He swung along the board walk, his face a
little pale, his lips tightly closed, determined to pay no attention to the
jeers that reached his ears.</p>

<p>When he passed the Fashion there were a number of men draped along its front;
and he was conscious of many grins. Passing the men he heard low laughter and
profane reference which caused his cheeks to redden. But he walked steadily on.
Near the <i>Kicker</i> office he met Jiggs Lenehan. Followed by the youth he
reached the office to find that Potter had completed the press work and that
several hundred copies of the paper, the ink still moist on its pages, were
stacked in orderly array on the imposing stone. In a very brief time Jiggs burst
out of the office door, a bundle of papers under his arm, and began the work of
distribution. Standing back from the window with Potter, Hollis watched <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span> Jiggs until the latter
reached the crowd in front of the Fashion saloon. Then all that Hollis could see
of him was his red head. But that trade was brisk was proved by the press around
Jiggs&#8211;the youth was passing out papers at a rapid rate and soon nearly
every man in the crowd about the Fashion was engaged in reading, or,&#8211;if
this important feature of his education had been neglected&#8211;in questioning
his neighbor concerning the things that appeared in the paper.</p>

<p>Presently Jigg&#8217;s customers in front of the Fashion were all supplied.
Then other purchasers appeared. Soon the <i>Kicker</i> was being read
by&#8211;it seemed&#8211;nearly every grown person in Dry Bottom. Business was
suspended. Down the street men were congregated about the doors of many of the
stores; others were sitting in doorways, still others leaned against buildings;
some, not taking time to search for support, read while walking, or stood
motionless on the board sidewalks, satisfying their curiosity.</p>

<p>Hollis watched through the window until he began to be certain that every
person in town was supplied with a paper. Then with a grim smile he left the
window and sought his chair beside the desk. He was satisfied. Dunlavey had made
the first aggressive movement and the fight was on.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span><a id='link_9'></a>CHAPTER IX<br /><span class='h2fs'>HOW A BAD MAN LEFT THE &#8220;KICKER&#8221; OFFICE</span></h2>

<p>It was about one o&#8217;clock in the afternoon when the <i>Kicker</i>
appeared on Dry Bottom&#8217;s street. At about five minutes after one, Potter
left the front of the office and walked to the rear room where he halted at the
imposing stone. There he proceeded to &#8220;take down&#8221; the four forms.
This done he calmly began distributing type.</p>

<p>While Potter worked Hollis sat very quietly at his desk in the front office,
his arms folded, one hand supporting his chin, his lips forming straight lines,
his eyes narrowed with a meditative expression. Occasionally Potter glanced
furtively at him, his eyes filled with mingled expressions of sympathy,
admiration, and concern.</p>

<p>Potter appreciated his chief&#8217;s position. It meant something for a man
of Hollis&#8217;s years and training to bury himself in this desolate sink-hole
of iniquity; to elect to carry on an unequal war with interests that controlled
the law machinery of the county and Territory&#8211;whose power extended to
Washington. No doubt the young <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_128'></a>128</span> man was even now brooding over the future, planning
his fight, pessimistically considering his chances of success. Potter&#8217;s
sympathy grew. He thought of approaching his chief with a word of encouragement.
But while he hesitated, mentally debating the propriety of such an action,
Hollis turned quickly and looked fairly at him, his forehead perplexed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Potter,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;I suppose there isn&#8217;t a good
brain specialist in this section of the country?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;why&#8213;&#8221; began Potter. Then he stopped and looked
at his chief in wordless astonishment. His sympathy had been wasted.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; laughed Hollis, divining the cause of the
compositor&#8217;s astonishment, &#8220;personally I have no use for a brain
specialist. I was thinking of some other person.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not me?&#8221; grinned Potter from behind his type case. He flushed a
little at the thought of how near he had come to offering encouragement to a man
who had not been in need of it, who, evidently, had not been thinking of the big
fight at all. &#8220;Perhaps I need one,&#8221; he added, eyeing Hollis
whimsically; &#8220;a moment ago I thought you were in the dumps on account of
the situation here&#8211;you seemed rather disturbed. It surprised me
considerably to find that you had not been thinking of Dunlavey at
all.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_129'></a>129</span>&#8220;No,&#8221; admitted Hollis gravely, &#8220;I
was not thinking of Dunlavey. I was wondering if something couldn&#8217;t be
done for Ed Hazelton.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Something ought to be done for him,&#8221; declared Potter earnestly.
&#8220;I have watched that young man closely and I am convinced that with proper
care and treatment he would recover fully. But I never heard of a specialist in
this section&#8211;none, in fact, nearer than Chicago. And I&#8217;ve forgotten
his name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is Hammond,&#8221; supplied Hollis. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking
of him. I knew his son in college. I am going to write to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned to his desk and took up a pen, while Potter resumed his work of
distributing type.</p>

<p>About half an hour later Jiggs Lenehan strolled into the office wearing a
huge grin on his face. &#8220;&#8217;Pears like everybody in town wants to read the
<i>Kicker</i> to-day,&#8221; he said with a joyous cackle. &#8220;Never had so
much fun sellin&#8217; them. Gimme some more,&#8221; he added breathlessly;
&#8220;they&#8217;s a gang down to the station howlin&#8217; for them.
Say,&#8221; he yelled at Hollis as he went out of the door with a big bundle of
<i>Kickers</i> under his arm, &#8220;you&#8217;re cert&#8217;nly some editor
man!&#8221; He grinned admiringly and widely as he disappeared.</p>

<p>Hollis finished his letter to Hammond and then leaned back in his chair. For
half an hour <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span> he
sat there, looking gravely out into the street and then, answering a sudden
impulse, he rose and strode to the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Going down to the court house,&#8221; he informed Potter.</p>

<p>He found Judge Graney in his room, seated at the big table, a copy of the
<i>Kicker</i> spread out in front of him. At his appearance the Judge pushed
back his chair and regarded him with an approving smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Hollis,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I see Dunlavey has played the
first card.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t taken the first trick,&#8221; was the young
man&#8217;s quick reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fortunately not,&#8221; laughed the judge. He placed a finger on a
column in the <i>Kicker</i>. &#8220;This article about the Cattlemen&#8217;s
Association is a hummer&#8211;if I may be allowed the phrase. A straight, manly
citation of the facts. It ought to win friends for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve merely stated the truth,&#8221; returned Hollis, &#8220;and
if the article seems good it is merely because it defends a principle whose
virtue is perfectly obvious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But only a man who felt strongly could have written it,&#8221;
suggested the Judge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps. I admit feeling a deep interest in the question of
cattle.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>&#8220;Your
ambition?&#8221; slyly insinuated the Judge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is temporarily in abeyance&#8211;perhaps permanently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then your original decision about remaining here has been&#8211;well,
strengthened?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis nodded. The Judge grinned mysteriously. &#8220;There is an article on
the first page of the <i>Kicker</i> which interested me greatly,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;It concerns the six o&#8217;clock train&#8211;going east. Do you happen
to know whether the editor of the <i>Kicker</i> is going to use the
express?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis smiled appreciatively. &#8220;The editor of the <i>Kicker</i> is going
to use the express,&#8221; he admitted, &#8220;though not in the manner some
people are wishing. The usual number of copies of the <i>Kicker</i> are going to
ride on the express, as are also some very forceful letters to the President of
the United States and the Secretary of the Interior.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; said the Judge. He looked critically at Hollis. &#8220;I
know that you are going to remain in Dry Bottom,&#8221; he said slowly; &#8220;I
have never doubted your courage. But I want to warn you to be careful.
Don&#8217;t make the mistake of thinking that the notice which you found on the
door of the <i>Kicker</i> office this morning is a joke. They don&#8217;t joke
like that out here. Of course I know that you are not afraid and that <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span> you won&#8217;t run. But
be careful&#8211;there are men out here who would snuff out a human life as
quickly as they would the flame of a candle, and with as little fear of the
consequences. I shouldn&#8217;t like to hear of you using your revolver, but if
you do have occasion to use it, use it fast and make a good job of
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like to use a gun,&#8221; returned Hollis gravely,
&#8220;but all the same I shall bear your advice in mind.&#8221; An expression
of slight disgust swept over his face. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see why men out here
don&#8217;t exhibit a little more courage,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They all
&#8216;pack&#8217; a gun, as Norton says, and all are apparently yearning to use one.
I don&#8217;t see what satisfaction there could be in shooting a man with whom
you have had trouble; it strikes me as being a trifle cowardly.&#8221; He
laughed grimly. &#8220;For my part,&#8221; he added, &#8220;I can get more
satisfaction out of slugging a man. Perhaps it isn&#8217;t so artistic as
shooting, but you have the satisfaction of knowing that your antagonist realizes
and appreciates his punishment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Judge Graney&#8217;s gaze rested on the muscular frame of the young man.
&#8220;I suppose if all men were built like you there would be less shooting
done. But unfortunately nature has seen fit to use different molds in making her
men. Not every man has the strength or science to use his fists, nor the
courage. But there is one thing <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_133'></a>133</span> that you will do well to remember. When you slug a
man who carries a gun you only beat him temporarily; usually he will wait his
chance and use his gun when you least expect him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you refer to Yuma Ed and Dunlavey?&#8221; suggested
Hollis.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, no, not Dunlavey. I have never heard of Dunlavey shooting
anybody; he plays a finer game. But Yuma Ed, Greasy, Ten Spot, and some more who
belong to the Dunlavey crowd are professional gun-men and do not hesitate to
shoot. The chances are that Dunlavey will try to square accounts with you in
some other manner, but I would be careful of Yuma&#8211;a blow in the face never
sets well on a man of that character.&#8221;</p>

<p>An hour later, when Hollis sat at his desk in the <i>Kicker</i> office, Judge
Graney&#8217;s words were recalled to him. He was thinking of his conversation
with the Judge when Jiggs Lenehan burst into the office, breathless, his face
pale and his eyes swimming with news. He was trembling With excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ten Spot is comin&#8217; down here to put you out of business!&#8221;
he blurted out when he could get his breath. &#8220;I was in the Fashion
an&#8217; I heard him an&#8217; Yuma talkin&#8217; about you. Ten Spot is
comin&#8217; here at six o&#8217;clock!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis turned slowly in his chair and faced the <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span> boy. His cheeks whitened a little.
Judge Graney had been right. Hollis had rather expected at some time or other he
would have to have it out with Yuma, but he had expected he would have to deal
with Yuma himself. He smiled a little grimly. It made very little difference
whether he fought Yuma or some other man; when he had elected to remain in Dry
Bottom he had realized that he must fight somebody&#8211;everybody in the
Dunlavey crew. He looked at his watch and saw that the hands pointed to four.
Therefore he had two hours to prepare for Ten Spot&#8217;s coming. He smiled at
the boy, looked back into the composing room and saw that Potter had ceased his
labors and was leaning on a type case, watching him soberly. He grinned broadly
at Potter and turned to Jiggs.</p>

<p>&#8220;How many <i>Kickers</i> did you sell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two hundred an&#8217; ten,&#8221; returned the latter;
&#8220;everybody bought them.&#8221; He took a step forward; his hands clenching
with the excitement that still possessed him. &#8220;I told you Ten Spot was
comin&#8217; down here to kill you!&#8221; he said hoarsely and insistently.
&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you hear me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard you,&#8221; smiled Hollis, &#8220;and I understand perfectly.
But I don&#8217;t think we need to <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_135'></a>135</span> get excited over it. Just how much money did you
receive for the two hundred and ten papers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Six dollars an&#8217; two bits,&#8221; responded the boy, regarding
Hollis wonderingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is yours,&#8221; Hollis informed him; &#8220;there was to be no
charge for the <i>Kicker</i> to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy grinned with pleasure. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you want none of it?&#8221;
he inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is yours,&#8221; repeated Hollis. He reached out and grasped the
boy by the arm, drawing him close. &#8220;Now tell me what you heard at the
Fashion,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Rapidly, but with rather less excitement in his manner than he had exhibited
on his entrance, the boy related in detail the conversation he had overheard at
the Fashion. When he had finished Hollis patted him approvingly on the back.</p>

<p>&#8220;The official circulation manager of the <i>Kicker</i> has made
good,&#8221; he said with a smile. &#8220;Now go home and take a good rest and
be ready to deliver the <i>Kicker</i> next Saturday.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy backed away and stood looking at Hollis in surprise.
&#8220;Why!&#8221; he said in an awed voice, &#8220;you ain&#8217;t none scared
a-tall!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly am scared,&#8221; laughed Hollis; &#8220;scared that Ten
Spot will change his mind before six o&#8217;clock. Do you think he
will?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_136'></a>136</span>&#8220;No!&#8221; emphatically declared the boy.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t reckon that Ten Spot will change his mind a-tall.
He&#8217;ll sure come down here to shoot you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That relieves me,&#8221; returned Hollis dryly. &#8220;Now you go
home. But,&#8221; he warned, &#8220;don&#8217;t tell anyone that I am
scared.&#8221;</p>

<p>For an instant the boy looked at Hollis critically, searching his face with
all a boy&#8217;s unerring judgment for signs which would tell of insincerity.
Seeing none, he deliberately stretched a hand out to Hollis, his lips wreathing
into an approving grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Durned if you ain&#8217;t the stuff!&#8221; he declared.
&#8220;I&#8217;m just bettin&#8217; that Ten Spot ain&#8217;t scarin&#8217; you
none!&#8221; Then he backed out of the door and still grinning, disappeared.</p>

<p>After Jiggs had gone Hollis turned and smiled at Potter. &#8220;I suppose you
know this man Ten Spot,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Will he come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will come,&#8221; returned Potter. His face was pale and his lips
quivered a little as he continued: &#8220;Ten Spot is the worst of
Dunlavey&#8217;s set,&#8221; he said; &#8220;a dangerous, reckless taker of
human life. He is quick on the trigger and a dead shot. He is called Ten Spot
because of the fact that once, with a gun in each hand, he shot all the spots
from a ten of hearts at ten paces.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>Hollis sat
silent, thoughtfully stroking his chin. Potter smiled admiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that you don&#8217;t like to run,&#8221; he said; &#8220;you
aren&#8217;t that kind. But you haven&#8217;t a chance with Ten
Spot&#8211;unfortunately you haven&#8217;t had much experience with a
six-shooter.&#8221; Potter&#8217;s hands shook as he tried to resume work at the
type case. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think they would have nerve enough for that
game,&#8221; he added, advancing again toward Hollis. &#8220;I rather thought
they would try some other plan&#8211;something not quite so raw. But it seems
they have nerve enough for anything. Hollis&#8221; he concluded dejectedly,
&#8220;you&#8217;ve got to get out of town before six o&#8217;clock or Ten Spot
will kill you!</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got plenty of time,&#8221; he resumed as Hollis kept
silent; &#8220;it&#8217;s only a little after four. You can get on your horse
and be almost at the Circle Bar at six. No one can blame you for not
staying&#8211;everybody knows that you can&#8217;t handle a gun fast enough to
match Ten Spot. Maybe if you do light out and don&#8217;t show up in town for a
week or so this thing will blow over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you very much for that advice, Potter,&#8221; said Hollis
slowly. &#8220;I appreciate the fact that you are thinking of my safety. But of
course there is another side to the situation. You <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span> of course realize that if I run now I
am through here&#8211;no one would ever take me seriously after it had been
discovered that I had been run out of town by Ten Spot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a fact,&#8221; admitted Potter. &#8220;But of
course&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that is settled,&#8221; interrupted Hollis. &#8220;You
can&#8217;t change the situation by argument. I&#8217;ve got to face it and face
it alone. I&#8217;ve got to stay here until Ten Spot comes. If I can&#8217;t
beat him at his game he wins and you can telegraph East to my people.&#8221; He
rose and walked to the window, his back to the printer.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can knock off for to-day, Potter. Jump right on your pony and get
out to Circle Bar. I wouldn&#8217;t say anything to Norton or anyone until after
nine to-night and then if I don&#8217;t show up at the ranch you will know that
Ten Spot has got me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood at the window while Potter slowly drew off his apron, carefully
folded it and tucked it into a corner. He moved very deliberately, as though
reluctant to leave his chief. Had Hollis shown the slightest sign of weakening
Potter would have stayed. But watching closely he saw no sign of weakness in the
impassive face of his chief, and so, after he had made his preparations for
departure, he drew a deep breath <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_139'></a>139</span> of resignation and walked slowly to the back door,
where his pony was hitched. He halted at the threshold, looking back at his
chief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, good-bye then,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Hollis did not turn. &#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>Potter took one step outward, hesitated, and then again faced the front of
the office.</p>

<p>&#8220;Damn it, Hollis,&#8221; he said hoarsely, &#8220;don&#8217;t wait for
Ten Spot to start anything; when you see him coming in the door bore him.
You&#8217;ve got a right to; that&#8217;s the law in this country. When a man
gives you notice to leave town you&#8217;ve got a right to shoot him on
sight!&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment he stood, awaiting an answer. None came. Potter sighed and
stepped out through the door, leaving his chief alone.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>At one minute to six Hollis pulled out his watch. He sighed, replaced the
time-piece, and leaned back in his chair. A glance out through the window showed
him that the street was deserted except for here and there a cow pony drooping
over one of the hitching rails and a wagon or two standing in front of a store.
The sun was coming slantwise over the roofs; Hollis saw that the strip of shade
in front of the <i>Kicker</i> building had grown to wide proportions. He <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span> looked at his watch
again. It was one minute after six&#8211;and still there were no signs of Ten
Spot.</p>

<p>A derisive grin appeared on Hollis&#8217;s face. Perhaps Ten Spot had
reconsidered. He decided that he would wait until ten minutes after six; that
would give Ten Spot a decent margin of time for delay.</p>

<p>And then there was a sudden movement and a man stood just inside the office
door, a heavy revolver in his right hand, its muzzle menacing Hollis. The man
was tall and angular, apparently about thirty years old, with thin, cruel lips
and insolent, shifty eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Nds up!&#8221; he said sharply, swinging the revolver to a
threatening poise. &#8220;It&#8217;s six o&#8217;clock, you tenderfoot &#8213;
&#8213; &#8213; &#8213;!&#8221;</p>

<p>This was the vile epithet that had been applied to Hollis by Yuma Ed, which
had been the direct cause of Yuma&#8217;s downfall the day of Hollis&#8217;s
arrival in Dry Bottom. Hollis&#8217;s eyes flashed, but the man was several feet
from him and out of reach of his fists. Had Hollis been standing he would have
had no chance to reach the man before the latter could have made use of his
weapon. Therefore Hollis remained motionless in his chair, catching the
man&#8217;s gaze and holding it steadily with unwavering, narrowed eyes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>Though he had
waited for the coming of Ten Spot, he had formulated no plan of action; he had
felt that somehow he would come out of the clash with him without injury. He
still thought so. In spite of his danger he felt that some chance of escape
would be offered him. Grimly confident of this he smiled at the man, though
still holding his gaze, determined, if he saw the faintest flicker of decision
in his eyes, to duck and tackle him regardless of consequences.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you are Ten Spot?&#8221; he said slowly. He was surprised at
the steadiness of his voice.</p>

<p>The man grinned, his eyes alert, shifty, filled with a chilling menace.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got her right, tenderfoot,&#8221; he said; &#8220;&#8216;Ten
Spot&#8217;s&#8217; m&#8217; handle, an&#8217; if you&#8217;re a-feelin&#8217;
like criticizin&#8217; of her do her some rapid before I starts dealin&#8217;
out the lead which is in my pritty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just how one man could be so entirely remorseless as to shoot another when
that other man was looking straight into his eyes Hollis could not understand.
He could readily realize how a man could kill when provoked to anger, or when
brooding over an injury. But he had done nothing to Ten Spot&#8211;did not even
know him&#8211;had never seen him before, and how Ten Spot could deliberately
shoot him&#8211;without provocation&#8211;was <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_142'></a>142</span> incomprehensible. He was convinced that in order to
shoot, Ten Spot must work himself into an artificial rage, and he believed that
the vile epithet which Ten Spot had applied to him immediately upon his entrance
must be part of his scheme. He was convinced that had he shown the slightest
resentment over the application of the epithet Ten Spot would have shot him down
at once. Therefore he resolved to give the man no opportunity to work himself
into a rage. He smiled again as Ten Spot concluded and carelessly twisted
himself about in his chair until he was in a position to make a quick
spring.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ten Spot&#8217; is a picturesque name,&#8221; he remarked quietly,
not removing his gaze from Ten Spot&#8217;s eyes for the slightest fraction of a
second; &#8220;I have no criticism to make. I have always made it a point to
refrain from criticizing my visitors. At least I do not recollect ever having
criticized a visitor who carried a gun,&#8221; he concluded with a smile.</p>

<p>Ten Spot&#8217;s lips curled sarcastically. Apparently he would not swerve in
his determination to provoke trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hell,&#8221; he said truculently, &#8220;that there palaver makes me
sick. I reckon you&#8217;re too damn white livered to criticize a man
that&#8217;s lookin&#8217; at <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_143'></a>143</span> you. There ain&#8217;t no tenderfoot (here he
applied the unprintable epithet again) got nerve enough to criticize
nothin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis slowly raised his hands and placed them on the arms of his chair,
apparently to steady himself, but in reality to be ready to project himself out
of the chair in case he could discern any indication of action on Ten
Spot&#8217;s part.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ten Spot,&#8221; he said in a low, even, well controlled voice,
conciliatory, but filled with a manliness which no man could mistake, &#8220;at
four o&#8217;clock this afternoon I heard that you and Yuma Ed were framing up
your present visit. I am not telling who gave me the information,&#8221; he
added as he saw Ten Spot&#8217;s eyes brighten, &#8220;but that is what
happened. So you see I know what you have come for. You have come to kill me. Is
that correct?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ten Spot&#8217;s eyes narrowed&#8211;into them had come an appraising,
speculative glint. He nodded. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got her right,&#8221; he
admitted gruffly. &#8220;But if you knowed why didn&#8217;t you slope?&#8221; He
looked at Hollis with a half sneer, as though unable to decide whether Hollis
was a brave man or merely a fool.</p>

<p>Hollis saw the indecision in Ten Spot&#8217;s eyes and his own brightened. At
last he had planned a form of action and he cooly estimated the distance <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span> between himself and Ten
Spot. While Hollis had been speaking Ten Spot had taken a step forward and he
was now not over four or five feet distant. Into Ten Spot&#8217;s eyes had come
an amused, disdainful gleam; Hollis&#8217;s quiet, argumentative attitude had
disarmed him. This was exactly what Hollis had been waiting for.</p>

<p>Ten Spot seemed almost to have forgotten his weapon; it had sagged, the
muzzle pointing downward&#8211;the man&#8217;s mind had become temporarily
diverted from his purpose. When he saw Hollis move suddenly forward he
remembered his gun and tried to swing its muzzle upward, but it was too late.
Hollis had lunged forward, his left hand closing on Ten Spot&#8217;s right
wrist, his right fist reaching Ten Spot&#8217;s jaw in a full, sweeping,
crashing uppercut.</p>

<p>The would-be killer did not have even time enough to pull the trigger of his
six-shooter. It fell from his hand and thudded dully to the floor as his knees
doubled under him and he collapsed in an inert, motionless heap near the
door.</p>

<p>With a grim smile on his face Hollis picked up Ten Spot&#8217;s weapon and
placed it on the desk. For an instant he stood at the window, looking out into
the street. Down near the Fashion he saw some men&#8211;Yuma Ed among them. No
doubt they were waiting the sound of the pistol <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_145'></a>145</span> shot which would tell them that Ten Spot had
disposed of Hollis. Hollis grinned widely&#8211;Yuma and his gang were due for a
surprise. For perhaps a minute Hollis stood beside the desk, watching Ten Spot.
Then when the latter&#8217;s hands began to twitch and a trace of color appeared
in his face, Hollis pulled out his own revolver and approached him, standing
within a few feet of him and looking down at him.</p>

<p>There was no mark on Ten Spot&#8217;s jaw to show where Hollis&#8217;s blow
had landed, for his fist had struck flush on the point, its force directed
upward. Ten Spot&#8217;s mouth had been open at the instant and the snapping of
his teeth from the impact of the blow no doubt had much to do with his long
period of unconsciousness.</p>

<p>He stirred presently and then with an effort sat up and looked at his
conqueror with a glance of puzzled wonderment. Seeing Hollis&#8217;s weapon and
his own on the desk, the light of past events seemed to filter into his
bewildered brain. He grinned owlishly, felt of his jaw and then bowed his head,
a flush of shame overspreading his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Herd-rode!&#8221; he said dismally. &#8220;Herd-rode, an&#8217; by a
tenderfoot! Oh, Lordy!&#8221; He suddenly looked up at Hollis, his eyes flashing
with rage and defiance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Damn your hide, why don&#8217;t you shoot?&#8221; he <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span> demanded. He placed his
hands, palm down, on the floor, preparatory to rising, but ceased his efforts
when he heard Hollis&#8217;s voice, coldly humorous:</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall shoot you just the instant you get to your feet. I rather
think that I am running things here now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ten Spot sagged back and looked up at him. &#8220;Why I reckon you
are,&#8221; he said. No method of action having suggested itself to him, he
continued to sit, watching Hollis narrowly.</p>

<p>The latter retreated to his chair and dropped into it, moving deliberately.
When he spoke his voice was cold and metallic.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you first came into the office,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you
applied a vile epithet to me. Once after that you did it again. You have asked
me why I don&#8217;t shoot you. If you really want me to shoot you you can keep
your mouth closed for just one minute. If you want to continue to live you can
tell me that you didn&#8217;t mean a word of what you said on those two
occasions. It&#8217;s up to you.&#8221; He sat silent, looking steadily at Ten
Spot.</p>

<p>The latter fidgeted, shame again reddening his cheeks. &#8220;Why,&#8221; he
said finally, &#8220;I reckon she don&#8217;t go, tenderfoot. You see,
she&#8217;s only a noma de ploom which we uses when we wants to <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span> rile somebody. I
cert&#8217;nly didn&#8217;t mean nothin&#8217; by it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; drawled Hollis dryly; &#8220;I&#8217;ll call that
sufficient. But you certainly did &#8216;rile&#8217; me some.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon I must have done just that,&#8221; grinned Ten Spot ruefully.
&#8220;You&#8217;re shorely some she-wolf with them there claws of your&#8217;n.
An&#8217; I done laffed at Dunlavey an&#8217; Yuma after you&#8217;d clawed
them.&#8221; His face sobered, his eyes suddenly filling with an expression of
defiant resignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon when you&#8217;re done triflin&#8217; with me you c&#8217;n
start to pumpin&#8217; your lead,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There ain&#8217;t no
use of prolongin&#8217; the agony.&#8221; He looked steadily at Hollis, his eyes
filling with decision as he again placed his hands beside him on the floor to
rise.</p>

<p>&#8220;You c&#8217;n open the ball when you get damn good an&#8217;
ready,&#8221; he sneered, &#8220;but I&#8217;m gettin&#8217; up right now. I
ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to die off my pins like a damn coyote!&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose quickly, plainly expecting to be shot down the moment he reached his
feet. When he discovered that Hollis evidently intended to delay the fatal
moment he stiffened, his lips twitching queerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ten Spot,&#8221; said Hollis quietly, &#8220;by apologizing <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span> for what you said when
you came in you have shown that there is a great deal of the man left in you
despite your bad habits and associations. I am going to show you that I think
there is enough of the man left in you to trust you with your gun.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned abruptly to the desk and took up Ten Spot&#8217;s weapon, holding
it by the muzzle and presenting it to the latter. Ten Spot looked from the
weapon to Hollis and back again to the weapon, blank amazement pictured on his
face. Then he reached out mechanically, taking the weapon and holding it in his
hands, turning it over and over as though half inclined to believe that it was
not a revolver at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chuck full of cattridges, too!&#8221; he exclaimed in amazement, as he
examined the chambers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, hell&#8213;&#8221; He crouched and deftly swung the six-shooter
around, the butt in his hand, his finger resting on the trigger. In this
position he looked at Hollis.</p>

<p>The latter had not moved, but his own weapon was in his right hand, its
muzzle covering Ten Spot, and when the latter swung his weapon up Hollis smiled
grimly at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Using it?&#8221; he questioned.</p>

<p>For an instant it seemed that Ten Spot would. An exultant, designing
expression came into his <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_149'></a>149</span> eyes, he grinned, his teeth showing tigerishly.
Then suddenly he snapped himself erect and with a single, dexterous movement
holstered the weapon. Then his right hand came suddenly out toward Hollis.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shake!&#8221; he said. &#8220;By &#8213;, you&#8217;re
white!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis smiled as he returned the hearty handclasp.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re cert&#8217;nly plum grit,&#8221; assured Ten Spot as he
released Hollis&#8217;s hand and stepped back the better to look at the latter.
&#8220;But I reckon you&#8217;re some damn fool too. How did you know that I
wouldn&#8217;t turn you into a colander when you give me back my gun?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know,&#8221; smiled Hollis. &#8220;I just took a
chance. You see,&#8221; he added, &#8220;it was this way. I never intended to
shoot you. That sort of thing isn&#8217;t in my line and I don&#8217;t intend to
shoot anyone if there is any way out of it. But I certainly wasn&#8217;t going
to allow you to shoot me.&#8221; He smiled oddly. &#8220;So I watched my chance
and slugged you. Then when I was certain that you weren&#8217;t dangerous any
more I had to face another problem. If I had turned you loose after taking your
gun what would you have done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d have gone out an&#8217; rustled another gun an&#8217; come
back here an&#8217; salivated you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_150'></a>150</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what you would have
done,&#8221; smiled Hollis. &#8220;I intend to stay in this country, Ten Spot,
and if I had turned you loose without an understanding you would have shot me at
the first opportunity. As it stands now you owe me&#8213;-&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As it stands now,&#8221; interrupted Ten Spot, a queer expression on
his face, &#8220;I&#8217;m done shootin&#8217; as far as you&#8217;re
concerned.&#8221; He walked to the door, hesitated on the threshold and looked
back. &#8220;Mister man,&#8221; he said slowly, &#8220;mebbe you won&#8217;t
lick Big Bill in this here little mix-up, but I&#8217;m telling you that
you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to give him a damn good run for his money!
So-long.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stepped down and disappeared. For a moment Hollis looked after him, and
then he sat down at the desk, his face softening into a satisfied smile. It was
something to receive a tribute from a man like Ten Spot.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span><a id='link_10'></a>CHAPTER X<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE LOST TRAIL</span></h2>

<p>It was after seven o&#8217;clock when Hollis mounted his pony in the rear of
the <i>Kicker</i> office and rode out over the plains toward the Circle Bar. He
was properly elated by the outcome of his affair with Ten Spot. The latter had
come to the <i>Kicker</i> office as an enemy looking for an opportunity to kill.
He had left the office, perhaps not a friend, but at least a neutral,
sympathetic onlooker, for according to Hollis&#8217;s interpretation of his
words at parting he would take no further part in Dunlavey&#8217;s
campaign&#8211;at least he would do no more shooting.</p>

<p>Hollis was compelled to make a long detour in order to strike the Circle Bar
trail, and when at seven-thirty o&#8217;clock he rode down through a dry arroyo
toward a little basin which he must cross to reach a ridge that had been his
landmark during all his trips back and forth from Dry Bottom to the Circle Bar,
dusk had fallen and the shadows of the oncoming night were settling somberly
down over the plains.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>He rode slowly
forward; there was no reason for haste, for he had told Potter to say nothing
about the reason of his delay in leaving Dry Bottom, and Potter would not expect
him before nine o&#8217;clock. Hollis had warmed toward Potter this day; there
had been in the old printer&#8217;s manner that afternoon a certain solicitous
concern and sympathy that had struck a responsive chord in his heart. He was not
a sentimentalist, but many times during his acquaintance with Potter he had felt
a genuine pity for the man. It had been this sentiment which had moved him to
ask Potter to remove temporarily to the Circle Bar, though one consideration had
been the fact at the Circle Bar he would most of the time be beyond the evil
influence of Dry Bottom&#8217;s saloons. That Potter appreciated this had been
shown by his successful fight against temptation the night before, when
postponement of the publication of the <i>Kicker</i> would have been fraught
with serious consequences.</p>

<p>Riding down through the little basin at the end of the arroyo Hollis yielded
to a deep, stirring satisfaction over the excellent beginning he had made in his
fight against Dunlavey and the interests behind him. Many times he smiled,
thinking of the surprise his old friends in the East must have felt over the
perusal of their <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
copies of the <i>Kicker</i>; over the information that he&#8211;who had been
something of a figure in Eastern newspaperdom&#8211;had become the owner and
editor of a newspaper in a God-forsaken town in New Mexico, and that at the
outset he was waging war against interests that ridiculed a judge of the United
States Court. He smiled grimly. They might be surprised, but they must feel, all
who knew him, that he would stay and fight until victory rewarded him or until
black, bitter defeat became his portion. There could be no compromise.</p>

<p>When he reached the ridge toward which he had been riding for the greater
part of an hour night had come. The day had been hot, but there had been a
slight breeze, and in the <i>Kicker</i> office, with the front and rear doors
open, he had not noticed the heat very much. But just as he reached the ridge he
became aware that the breeze had died down; that waves of hot, sultry air were
rising from the sun-baked earth. Usually at this time of the night there were
countless stars, and now as he looked up into the great, vast arc of sky he saw
no stars at all except away down in the west in a big rift between some
mountains. He pulled up his pony and sat motionless in the saddle, watching the
sky. A sudden awe for the grandeur of the scene <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_154'></a>154</span> filled him. He remembered to have seen nothing
quite like it in the East.</p>

<p>Back toward Dry Bottom, and on the north and south, rose great, black
thunderheads with white crests, seeming like mountains with snowcapped peaks.
Between the thunder-heads were other clouds, of grayish-white, fleecy,
wind-whipped, weird shapes, riding on the wings of the Storm-Kings. Other clouds
flanked these, moving slowly and majestically&#8211;like great ships on the
sea&#8211;in striking contrast to the fleecy, unstable shapes between the
thunderheads, which, though rushing always onward, were riven and broken by the
irresistible force behind them. To Hollis it seemed there were two mighty
opposing forces at work in the sky, marshalling, maneuvering, preparing for
conflict. While he sat motionless in the saddle watching, a sudden gust of cold
wind swirled up around him, dashed some fine, flint-like sand against his face
and into his eyes, and then swept onward. He was blinded for an instant, and
allowed the reins to drop on his pony&#8217;s neck while he rubbed his eyes with
his fingers. He sat thus through an ominous hush and then to his ears came a
low, distant rumble.</p>

<p>He touched his pony lightly on the flanks with his spurs and headed it along
the ridge, convinced <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_155'></a>155</span> that a storm was coming and suddenly realizing that
he was many miles from shelter.</p>

<p>He had traveled only a little distance when clouds of sand and dust,
wind-driven, enveloped him, blinding him again, stinging his face and hands and
blotting out the landmarks upon which he depended to guide him to the Circle
Bar. The sky had grown blacker; even the patch of blue that he had seen in the
rift between the distant mountains was now gone. There was nothing above
him&#8211;it seemed&#8211;except inky black clouds, nothing below but chaos and
wind. He could not see a foot of the trail and so he gave the pony the rein,
trusting to its instinct.</p>

<p>When Norton had provided him with an outfit the inevitable tarpaulin had not
been neglected. Hollis remembered that this was attached to the cantle of the
saddle, and so, after he had proceeded a little way along the crest of the
ridge, he halted the pony, dismounted, unstrapped the tarpaulin, and folded it
about him. Then he remounted and continued on his way, mentally thanking Norton
for his foresight.</p>

<p>The pony had negotiated the ridge; had slowly loped down its slope to a
comparatively low and level stretch of country, and was traveling steadily
forward, when Hollis noticed a <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_156'></a>156</span> change in the atmosphere. It had grown hot
again&#8211;sultry; the heat seemed to cling to him. An ominous calm had
succeeded the aerial disturbance. From a great distance came a slight
sound&#8211;a gentle sighing&#8211;gradually diminishing until it died away
entirely. Then again came the ominous, premonitory silence&#8211;an absolute
absence of life and movement. Hollis urged the pony forward, hoping the calm
would last until he had covered a goodly part of the distance to the Circle Bar.
For a quarter of an hour he went on at a good pace. But he had scarcely reached
the edge of a stretch of broken country&#8211;which he dreaded even in the
daylight&#8211;when the storm was upon him.</p>

<p>It did not come unheralded. A blinding flash of lightning illuminated miles
of the surrounding country, showing Hollis the naked peaks of ridges and hills
around him; gullies, draws, barrancas, the levels, lava beds, fantastic rock
shapes&#8211;mocking his ignorance of the country. He saw them all for an
instant and then they were gone and darkness&#8211;blacker than
before&#8211;succeeded. It was as though a huge map had suddenly been thrust
before his eyes by some giant hand, an intense light thrown upon it, and the
light suddenly turned off. Immediately there came a heavy crash as though the
Storm-Kings, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
having marshalled their forces, had thrown them together in one, great, clashing
onrush. And then, straight down, roaring and shrieking, came the deluge.</p>

<p>The wise little plains-pony halted, standing with drooping head, awaiting the
end of the first fierce onslaught. It lasted long and when it had gone another
silence, as ominous as the preceding one, followed. The rain ceased entirely and
the pony again stepped forward, making his way slowly, for the trail was now
slippery and hazardous. The baked earth had become a slimy, sticky clay which
clung tenaciously to the pony&#8217;s hoofs.</p>

<p>For another quarter of an hour the pony floundered through the mud, around
gigantic boulders, over slippery hummocks, across little gullies, upon ridges
and small hills and down into comparatively level stretches of country. Hollis
was beginning to think that he might escape a bad wetting after all when the
rain came again.</p>

<p>This time it seemed the Storm-Kings were in earnest. The rain came down in
torrents; Hollis could feel it striking against his tarpaulin in long, stinging,
vicious slants, and the lightning played and danced along the ridges and into
the gullies with continuing energy, the thunder following, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span> crashing in terrific volleys. It was
uncomfortable, to say the least, and the only consoling thought was that the
deluge would prove a God-send to the land and the cattle. Hollis began to wish
that he had remained in Dry Bottom for the night, but of course Dry Bottom was
not to be thought of now; he must devote all his energy to reaching the
ranch.</p>

<p>It was slow work for the pony. After riding for another quarter of an hour
Hollis saw, during another lightning flash, another of his landmarks, and
realized that in the last quarter of an hour he had traveled a very short
distance. The continuing flashes of lightning had helped the pony forward, but
presently the lightning ceased and a dense blackness succeeded. The pony went
forward at an uncertain pace; several times it halted and faced about,
apparently undecided about the trail. After another half hour&#8217;s travel and
coming to a stretch of level country, the pony halted again, refusing to respond
to Hollis&#8217;s repeated urging to go forward without guidance. For a long
time Hollis continued to urge the animal&#8211;he cajoled, threatened&#8211;but
the pony would not budge. Hollis was forced to the uncomfortable realization
that it had lost the trail.</p>

<p>For a long time he sat quietly in the saddle, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span> trying in the dense darkness to
determine upon direction, but he finally gave it up and with a sudden impulse
took up the reins and pulled the pony to the left, determined to keep to the
flat country as long as possible.</p>

<p>He traveled for what seemed several miles, the pony gingerly feeling its way,
when suddenly it halted and refused to advance. Something was wrong. Hollis
leaned forward, attempting to peer through the darkness ahead, but not
succeeding. And now, as though having accomplished its design by causing Hollis
to lose the trail, the lightning flashed again, illuminating the surrounding
country for several miles.</p>

<p>Hollis had been peering ahead when the flash came and he drew a deep breath
of horror and surprise. The pony had halted within a foot of the edge of a high
cliff whose side dropped away sheer, as though cut with a knife. Down below,
perhaps a hundred feet, was an immense basin, through which flowed a stream of
water. To Hollis&#8217;s right, parallel with the stream, the cliff sloped
suddenly down, reaching the water&#8217;s edge at a distance of two or three
hundred feet. Beyond that was a stretch of sloping country many miles in area,
and, also on his right, was a long, high, narrow ridge. He recognized the ridge
as the one on which he and Norton had ridden <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_160'></a>160</span> some six weeks before&#8211;on the day he had had
the adventure with Ed Hazelton. Another flash of lightning showed him two
cotton-wood trees&#8211;the ones pointed out to him by Norton as marking Big Elk
crossing&#8211;the dead line set by Dunlavey and his men.</p>

<p>Hollis knew his direction now and he pulled the pony around and headed it
away from the edge of the cliff and toward the flat country which he knew led
down through the canyon to Devil&#8217;s Hollow, where he had taken leave of Ed
and Nellie Hazelton. He was congratulating himself upon his narrow escape when a
flash of lightning again illuminated the country and he saw, not over a hundred
feet distant, sitting motionless on their ponies, a half dozen cowboys. Also on
his pony, slightly in advance of the others, a grin of derision on his face, was
Dunlavey.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span><a id='link_11'></a>CHAPTER XI<br /><span class='h2fs'>PICKING UP THE TRAIL</span></h2>

<p>At about the time that the storm had overtaken Hollis, Potter was unsaddling
his pony at the Circle Bar corral gate. A little later he was on the wide lower
gallery of the ranchhouse washing the stains of travel from his face and hands.
At supper he was taciturn, his face deeply thoughtful. Had Ten Spot come? What
had been the outcome of the meeting? These questions preyed on his mind and
brought furrows into his face.</p>

<p>At supper he caught Norton watching him furtively and he flushed guiltily,
for he felt that in spite of Hollis&#8217;s order to say nothing to Norton he
should have told. He had already informed Norton that Hollis intended remaining
in Dry Bottom until a later hour than usual, but he had said nothing about the
intended visit of Ten Spot to the <i>Kicker</i> office. Loyalty to Hollis kept
him from communicating to Norton his fears for Hollis&#8217;s safety. It was now
too late to do anything if he did tell Norton; whatever had <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span> been done had been done already and
there was nothing for him to do but to wait until nine o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>After he finished his meal he drew a chair out upon the gallery and placing
it in a corner from where he could see the Dry Bottom trail he seated himself in
it and tried to combat the disquieting fears that oppressed him. When Norton
came out and took a chair near him he tried to talk to the range boss upon those
small subjects with which we fill our leisure, but he could not hold his
thoughts to these trivialities. He fell into long silences; his thoughts kept
going back to Dry Bottom.</p>

<p>When the rain came he felt a little easier, for he had a hope that Hollis
might have noticed the approach of the storm and decided to remain in town until
it had passed. But after the rain had ceased his fears again returned. He looked
many times at his watch and when Mrs. Norton came to the door and announced her
intention of retiring he scarcely noticed her. Norton had repeatedly referred to
Hollis&#8217;s absence, and each time Potter had assured him that Hollis would
come soon. Shortly before nine o&#8217;clock, when the clouds lifted and the
stars began to appear, Potter rose and paced the gallery floor. At nine, when it
had become light enough to see <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_163'></a>163</span> quite a little distance down the Dry Bottom trail
and there were still no signs of Hollis, he blurted out the story of the
day&#8217;s occurrences.</p>

<p>The information acted upon Norton like an electric shock. He was on his feet
before Potter had finished speaking, grasping him by the shoulders and shaking
him roughly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you say something before?&#8221; he demanded.
&#8220;Why did you leave him? Wasn&#8217;t there somebody in Dry Bottom that you
could have sent out here to tell me?&#8221; He cursed harshly. &#8220;Ten
Spot&#8217;s got him!&#8221; he declared sharply, his eyes glittering savagely.
&#8220;He&#8217;d have been here by this time!&#8221; He was taking a hitch in
his cartridge belt while talking, and before concluding he was down off the
gallery floor and striding toward the corral.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell my wife that I&#8217;ve gone to Dry Bottom,&#8221; he called back
to Potter. &#8220;Important business! I&#8217;ll be back shortly after
midnight!&#8221;</p>

<p>Leaving Potter on the porch staring after him he ran to the corral, roped his
pony, threw on a saddle and bridle and mounted with the animal on a run.</p>

<p>The stars were shining brilliantly now and from the porch Potter could see
Norton racing down the Dry Bottom trail with his pony in a furious gallop. For a
time Potter watched him, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_164'></a>164</span> then he disappeared and Potter went into the house
to communicate his message to his wife.</p>

<p>The rain had been heavy while it lasted, but by the time Norton had begun his
race to Dry Bottom very little evidence of it remained and the pony&#8217;s
flying hoofs found the sand of the trail almost as dry and hard as before the
storm. Indeed, there was now little evidence that there had been a storm at
all.</p>

<p>Norton spared the pony only on the rises and in something over an hour after
the time he had left the Circle Bar he drew up in front of the <i>Kicker</i>
office in Dry Bottom, dismounted, and bounded to the door. It was locked. He
placed a shoulder against it and crashed it in, springing inside and lighting a
match. He smiled grimly when he saw no signs of Hollis; when he saw that the
interior was in an orderly condition and that there were no signs of a conflict.
If Ten Spot had killed Hollis he had done the deed outside the <i>Kicker</i>
office.</p>

<p>Norton came out again, pulling the wreck of the door after him and closing it
as well as he could. Then, leaving his pony, he strode toward the Fashion
saloon. As he came near he heard sounds of revelry issuing from the open door
and he smiled coldly. A flashing glance through the window showed him that Ten
Spot <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span> was there,
standing at the bar. In the next instant Norton was inside, confronting Ten
Spot, his big six-shooter out and shoved viciously against Ten Spot&#8217;s
stomach.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you done with Hollis, you mangy son-of-a-gun?&#8221; he
demanded.</p>

<p>Several men who had been standing at the bar talking and laughing fell silent
and looked at the two men, the barkeeper sidled closer, crouching warily, for he
knew Norton.</p>

<p>Ten Spot had spread his arms out on the bar and was leaning against it,
looking at Norton in unfeigned bewilderment. He did not speak at once. Then
suddenly aware of the foreboding, savage gleam in Norton&#8217;s eyes, a glint
of grim humor came into his own and his lips opened a little, curling
sarcastically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; he said, looking at Norton, &#8220;I don&#8217;t reckon to
be anyone&#8217;s keeper.&#8221; He smiled widely, with a suddenly ludicrous
expression. &#8220;If you&#8217;re talkin&#8217; about that tenderfoot noospaper
guy, he don&#8217;t need no keeper. What have I done to him?&#8221; he repeated,
his smile growing. &#8220;Why, I reckon I didn&#8217;t do a heap; I went down to
call on him. He was right sociable. I was goin&#8217; to be mean to him, but I
just couldn&#8217;t. When he left he was sayin&#8217; that he&#8217;d be right
glad to see me again&#8211;he&#8217;d been right <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span> playful durin&#8217; my talk with him.
I reckon by now he&#8217;s over at the Circle Bar laffin&#8217; hisself to sleep
over the mean way I treated him. You just ast him when you see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>A flicker of doubt came into Norton&#8217;s eyes&#8211;Ten Spot&#8217;s words
had the ring of truth.</p>

<p>&#8220;You went down there to shoot him!&#8221; he said coldly, still
unconvinced.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mebbe I did,&#8221; returned Ten Spot. &#8220;Howsomever, I
didn&#8217;t. I ain&#8217;t tellin&#8217; how I come to change my
mind&#8211;that&#8217;s my business, an&#8217; you can&#8217;t shoot it out of
me. But I&#8217;m tellin&#8217; you this: me an&#8217; that guy has agreed to
call it quits, an&#8217; if I hear any man talkin&#8217; extravagant about him,
me an&#8217; that man&#8217;s goin&#8217; to have a run in mighty sudden!&#8221;
He laughed. &#8220;Someone&#8217;s been funnin&#8217; you,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;When he handed me back my gun after sluggin&#8217;&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>But he was now talking to Norton&#8217;s back, for the range boss was at the
door, striding rapidly toward his pony. He mounted again and rode out on the
trail, proceeding slowly, convinced that something had happened to Hollis after
he had left Dry Bottom. It was more than likely that he had lost his way in the
storm, and in that case he would probably arrive at the Circle Bar over some
round-about trail. He was now certain that he had not been molested in town; if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span> he had been some
of the men in the Fashion would have told him about it. Hollis would probably be
at the ranch by the time he arrived, to laugh at his fears. Nevertheless he rode
slowly, watching the trail carefully, searching the little gullies and peering
into every shadow for fear that Hollis had been injured in some accident and
might be lying near unable to make his presence known.</p>

<p>The dawn was just showing above the horizon when he rode up to the ranchhouse
to find Potter standing on the porch&#8211;apparently not having left there
during his absence. Beside Potter stood Ed Hazelton, and near the latter a
drooping pony, showing signs of hard riding.</p>

<p>Norton passed the corral gate and rode up to the two men. A glance at their
faces told him that something had gone wrong. But before he could speak the
question that had formed on his lips Hazelton spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;They got him, Norton,&#8221; he said slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dead?&#8221; queried Norton sharply, his lips straightening.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; returned Hazelton gloomily; &#8220;he ain&#8217;t dead. But
when I found him he wasn&#8217;t far from it. Herd-rode him, the damned sneaks!
Beat him up so&#8217;s his own mother wouldn&#8217;t know him!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_168'></a>168</span>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; commanded Norton.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going with you. I suppose you&#8217;ve got him over to your
shack?&#8221; He caught Hazelton&#8217;s nod and issued an order to Potter.
&#8220;Go down to the bunkhouse and get Weary out. Tell him to hit the breeze to
Cimarron for the doctor. If the doc&#8217; don&#8217;t want to come drag him by
the ears!&#8221;</p>

<p>He spurred his pony furiously to the corral gate and in a short time had
saddled another horse and was back where Hazelton was awaiting him. Without
speaking a word to each other the two men rode rapidly down the Coyote trail,
while Potter, following directions, his face haggard and drawn from loss of
sleep and worry, hurried to the bunkhouse to arouse Weary and send him on his
long journey to Cimarron.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span><a id='link_12'></a>CHAPTER XII<br /><span class='h2fs'>AFTER THE STORM</span></h2>

<p>Hollis&#8217;s tall figure lay pitifully slack on a bed in the Hazelton
cabin. Nellie Hazelton had given him what care she could out of her limited
knowledge and now nothing more could be done until the arrival of the Cimarron
doctor. Swathed in bandages, his clothing torn and soiled&#8211;as though after
beating him his assailants had dragged him through the mud&#8211;one hand
queerly twisted, his face swollen, his whole great body looking as though it had
received the maximum of injury, Hollis moved restlessly on the bed, his head
rolling oddly from side to side, incoherent words issuing from between his
bruised and swollen lips.</p>

<p>Norton stood beside the bed, looking down at the injured man with a grim,
savage pity.</p>

<p>&#8220;The damned cowards!&#8221; he said, his voice quivering. &#8220;There
must have been a dozen of them&#8211;to do him up like that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seven,&#8221; returned Ed Hazelton grimly. &#8220;They left their
trail there; I counted the hoof <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_170'></a>170</span> prints, an&#8217; they led down the slope toward
Big Elk crossin&#8217;.&#8221; He looked at Norton with a frown. &#8220;We
can&#8217;t do anything here,&#8221; he said shortly, &#8220;until the doctor
comes. I&#8217;ll take you down where I found him.&#8221;</p>

<p>They went out and mounted their ponies. Down the trail a mile or so they came
to a level that led away toward Rabbit-Ear Creek. From the level they could see
the Circle Cross buildings, scattered over a small stretch of plain on the
opposite side of the river. There was no life around them, no movement. Norton
grimaced toward them.</p>

<p>Hazelton halted his pony in some tall grass near a bare, sandy spot on the
plains. The grass here grew only in patches and Norton could plainly see a
number of hoof prints in the sand. One single set led away across the plains
toward the Dry Bottom trail. Seeing the knowing expression in Norton&#8217;s
eyes, Hazelton spoke quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Hollis&#8217;s trail. He must have took the Dry Bottom
trail an&#8217; lost it in the storm. Potter says he would probably take it
because it&#8217;s shorter. Anyways, it&#8217;s his trail; I followed it back
into the hills until I was sure. I saw that he had been comin&#8217; from Dry
Bottom. He lost his way an&#8217; rode over here. I remember <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span> there was an awful
darkness, for I was out scoutin&#8217; around to see if my stock was all right.
Well, he got this far&#8211;rode right up to the edge of the butte over there
an&#8217; then come back this way. Then he met&#8211;well, the men that did
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They all stood there for a little while; you can see where their
horses pawed. Then mebbe they started somethin&#8217;, for you can see where
Hollis&#8217;s pony throwed up a lot of sand, tryin&#8217; to break out. The
others were in a circle&#8211;you can see that. I&#8217;ve figured it out that
Hollis saw there wasn&#8217;t any chance for him against so many an&#8217; he
tried to hit the breeze away from here. I&#8217;ll show you.&#8221;</p>

<p>They followed the hoof prints down the slope and saw that all the riders must
have been traveling fast at this point, for the earth was cut and the hoof
prints bunched fore and aft. They ran only a little way, however. About a
hundred yards down the slope, in a stretch of bare, sandy soil, the horses had
evidently come to a halt again, for they were bunched well together and there
were many of them, showing that there had been some movement after the halt.</p>

<p>Norton dismounted and examined the surrounding soil.</p>

<p>&#8220;They all got off here,&#8221; he said shortly, after the examination;
&#8220;there&#8217;s the prints of their <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_172'></a>172</span> boots. They caught him here and handed it to
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazelton silently pointed to a queer track in the sand&#8211;a shallow groove
running about fifty feet, looking as though some heavy object had been drawn
over it. Norton&#8217;s face whitened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Drug him!&#8221; he said grimly, his lips in two straight lines.
&#8220;It&#8217;s likely they roped him!&#8221; He remounted his pony and sat in
the saddle, watching Hazelton as the latter continued his examination.
&#8220;They&#8217;re a fine, nervy bunch!&#8221; he sneered as Hazelton also
climbed into his saddle. &#8220;They must have piled onto him like a pack of
wolves. If they&#8217;d have come one at a time he&#8217;d have cleaned them up
proper!&#8221;</p>

<p>They rode away down the trail toward the cabin. Norton went in and looked
again at Hollis, and then, telling Hazelton that he would return in the
afternoon, he departed for the Circle Bar. He stopped at the ranchhouse and
communicated the news to his wife and Potter and then rode on up the river to a
point about ten miles from the ranchhouse&#8211;where the outfit was
working.</p>

<p>The men received his news with expressions of rage and vengeance. They had
come to admire Hollis for his courage in electing to continue the fight against
Dunlavey; they had seen that in <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_173'></a>173</span> spite of his ignorance of the customs of their
world he possessed a goodly store of common sense and an indomitable spirit. Yet
none of them expressed sympathy, though their faces showed that they felt it.
Expressions of sympathy in a case such as this would have been unnecessary and
futile. But their expressions of rage showed how the news had affected them.
Though they knew that Dunlavey&#8217;s forces outnumbered their own they were
for striking back immediately. But Norton discouraged this.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re layin&#8217; low for a while,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Mebbe
the boss will get well. If he does he&#8217;ll make things mighty
interestin&#8217; for Dunlavey&#8211;likely he&#8217;ll remember who was in the
crowd which beat him up. If he dies&#8213;&#8221; His eyes flashed savagely.
&#8220;Well, if he dies you boys can go as far as you like an&#8217; I&#8217;ll
go with you without doin&#8217; any kickin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be done with that noospaper of
his&#8217;n?&#8221; inquired Ace. &#8220;You reckon she&#8217;ll miss fire till
he&#8217;s well again?&#8221;</p>

<p>Norton&#8217;s brows wrinkled; he had not thought of the newspaper. But he
realized now that if the paper failed to appear on scheduled time the people in
Union County would think that Hollis had surrendered; they would refuse to
believe that he had been so badly injured that he <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span> could not issue the paper, and Dunlavey
would be careful to circulate some sort of a story to encourage this view. Now
that Ace had brought the matter to his attention he began to suspect that this
had been the reason of the attack on Hollis. That they had not killed him when
they had the opportunity, showed that they must have had some purpose other than
that of merely desiring to get him out of the way. That they had merely beaten
him showed that their wish was only to incapacitate him temporarily.
Norton&#8217;s eyes flashed with a sudden determination.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t reckon that the <i>Kicker</i> will miss fire,&#8221; he
declared; &#8220;not if I have to go to Dry Bottom an&#8217; get her out
myself!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ace eyed him furtively and now spoke with an embarrassed
self-consciousness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been considerin&#8217; this here situation ever since you
told us about the boss,&#8221; he said diffidently, &#8220;an&#8217; if
you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to get that paper out, a little poem or two might help
out considerable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Meanin&#8217;?&#8221; interrogated Norton, his eyelashes
flickering.</p>

<p>Ace&#8217;s face reddened painfully. &#8220;Meanin&#8217; that I&#8217;ve got
several little pieces which I&#8217;ve wrote when I didn&#8217;t have anything
else to do an&#8217; that I&#8217;d be right willin&#8217; to have them put into
the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span> <i>Kicker</i>
to help fill her up. Some of the boys think they&#8217;re right
classy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Norton looked around at the other men for confirmation of the truth of this
modest statement. He caught Lanky&#8217;s glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon that&#8217;s about right,&#8221; said that sober-faced
puncher; &#8220;Ace is the pote lariat of this here outfit, an&#8217; he sure
has got a lot of right clever lines in his pomes. I&#8217;ve read them which
wasn&#8217;t one-two-three with his&#8217;n.&#8221;</p>

<p>Norton smiled, a little cynically. He wasn&#8217;t quite sure about it, he
said, but if Ace could write poetry he hadn&#8217;t any doubt that during the
next few weeks there would be plenty of opportunity to print some of it in the
<i>Kicker</i>. He smiled when he saw Ace&#8217;s face brighten. But he told him he
would have to see Hollis&#8211;if the latter got well enough to endure an
interview. If the boss recovered enough to be able to look at Ace&#8217;s poetry
before it was printed, why of course it would have to be shown him. He
didn&#8217;t want anything to go into the <i>Kicker</i> which the boss
wouldn&#8217;t like. But if he wasn&#8217;t able to look at it, why he would
leave the decision to Potter, and if it suited the latter he would be satisfied.
He would keep the boys posted on the boss&#8217;s condition. Then he rode away
toward the ranchhouse.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>Late in the
afternoon he again visited the Hazelton cabin. He found the Cimarron doctor
already there. Hollis was still unconscious, though resting easier. The doctor
declared that he would remain with him throughout the night. He followed Norton
out on to the porch and told him that at present he could not tell just how
serious Hollis&#8217;s injuries were. There was a great wound in his head which
he feared might turn out seriously, but if not, Hollis would recover quickly and
be as good as ever within a few weeks&#8211;except for his left
wrist&#8211;which was broken. He praised Nellie Hazelton for the care she was
giving the injured man. Convinced that there was nothing more to be done, Norton
returned to the Circle Bar to give his attention to his work.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span><a id='link_13'></a>CHAPTER XIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>&#8220;WOMAN&#8211;SHE DON&#8217;T NEED NO TOOTER&#8221;</span></h2>

<p>The Cimarron doctor&#8217;s fears for the wound on Hollis&#8217;s head had
proved unfounded and on the tenth day after his experience on the night of the
storm, Hollis was sitting on the Hazelton porch, his head still swathed in
bandages, his left wrist in a splint, but his spirit still untouched. The marks
on his face had all disappeared, except an ugly gash under his right
eye&#8211;which still showed a slight discoloration&#8211;and a smaller cut on
the chin. The Cimarron doctor had told him that the wound under his eye would
leave a permanent scar&#8211;the wound had been deep and in spite of the
doctor&#8217;s care, had drawn together queerly, affecting the eye itself and
giving it an odd expression. Many times since becoming able to move about had
Hollis looked at his face in his mirror, and each time there had come into his
eyes an expression that boded ill for the men who had been concerned in the
attack on him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>It was
mid-afternoon and the sun was coming slant-wise over the roof of the cabin,
creating a welcome shade on the porch. Ed Hazelton had been gone since morning,
looking after his cattle, and Nellie was in the house, busily at work in the
kitchen&#8211;Hollis could hear her as she stepped about the room.</p>

<p>Norton had left the cabin an hour before and a little later Potter had
stopped in on his way over to Dry Bottom to set up an article that he had
written at Hollis&#8217;s dictation. Hollis had told Norton of his experiences
on the night of the storm.</p>

<p>After the flash of lightning had revealed Dunlavey and his men, Hollis had
attempted to escape, knowing that Dunlavey&#8217;s intentions could not be
peaceable, and that he would have no chance in a fight with several men. He had
urged his pony toward the two buttes that he had seen during the lightning
flash, making a circuit in order to evade his enemies. He might have succeeded,
but unfortunately the darkness had lifted and they had been able to intercept
him. He could give no clear account of what had happened after they had
surrounded him. There had been no words spoken. He had tried to break out of the
circle; had almost succeeded when a loop settled over his shoulders and he <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span> was dragged from his
pony&#8211;dragged quite a distance.</p>

<p>The fall had hurt him, but when the rope had slackened he had regained his
feet&#8211;to see that all the men had surrounded him. One man struck at him and
he had immediately struck back, knocking the man down. After that the blows came
thick and fast. He hit several more faces that were close to him and at one time
was certain he had put three of his assailants out of the fight. But the others
had crowded him close. He fought them as well as he could with the great odds
against him, and once was inspired with a hope that he might escape. Then had
come a heavy blow on the head&#8211;he thought that one of the men had used the
butt of a revolver. He could dimly remember receiving a number of other blows
and then he knew nothing more until he had awakened in the Hazelton cabin.</p>

<p>Hollis&#8217;s opinion of Dunlavey&#8217;s motive in thus attacking him
coincided with Norton&#8217;s. They might easily have killed him. That they did
not showed that they must have some peculiar motive. Aside from a perfectly
natural desire on Dunlavey&#8217;s part to deal to Hollis the same sort of
punishment that Hollis had inflicted on Dunlavey on the occasion of their first
meeting, the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
latter could have no motive other than that of preventing the appearance of the
<i>Kicker</i> on its regular publication day.</p>

<p>Hollis was convinced that Dunlavey had been inspired by both motives. But
though Dunlavey had secured his revenge for the blow that Hollis had struck him
in Dry Bottom, Hollis did not purpose to allow him to prevent the appearance of
the <i>Kicker</i>. It had been impossible for him to make the trip to Dry
Bottom, but he had summoned Potter and had dictated considerable copy, Potter
had written some, and in this manner they had managed to get the <i>Kicker</i>
out twice.</p>

<p>Ace had not been able to get any of his poems into the <i>Kicker</i>. He had
submitted some of them to Potter, but the printer had assured him that he did
not care to assume the responsibility of publishing them. Thereupon Ace had
importuned Norton to intercede with Hollis on his behalf. On his visit this
morning Norton had brought the matter to Hollis&#8217;s attention. The latter
had assured the range boss that he appreciated the puncher&#8217;s interest and
would be glad to go over some of his poems. Therefore Hollis was not surprised
when in the afternoon he saw Ace loping his pony down the Coyote trail toward
the Hazelton cabin.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>Ace&#8217;s
approach was diffident, though ambition urged him on. He rode up to the edge of
the porch, dismounted, and greeted his boss with an earnestness that contrasted
oddly with his embarrassment. He took the chair that Hollis motioned him to,
sitting on the edge of it and shifting nervously under Hollis&#8217;s direct
gaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon Norton told you about my poems,&#8221; he began. He caught
Hollis&#8217;s nod and continued: &#8220;Well, I got a bunch of &#8217;em here
which I brung over to show you. Folks back home used to say that I was a genyus.
But I reckon mebbe they was hittin&#8217; her up a little bit strong,&#8221; he
admitted, modestly; &#8220;folks is that way&#8211;they like to spread it on a
bit. But&#8221;&#8211;and the eyes of the genius flashed proudly&#8211;&#8220;I
reckon I&#8217;ve got a little talyunt, the evidence of which is right
here!&#8221; With rather more composure than had marked his approach he now drew
out a prodigious number of sheets of paper, which he proceeded to spread out on
his knee, smoothing them lovingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mebbe I ain&#8217;t much on spellin&#8217; an&#8217; grammar an&#8217;
all that sort of thing,&#8221; he offered, &#8220;but there&#8217;s a heap of
sense to be got out of the stuff I&#8217;ve wrote. Take this one, for instance.
She&#8217;s a little oday to &#8216;Night,&#8217; which I composed while the boys was
poundin&#8217; their ears one night&#8211;not <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_182'></a>182</span> bein&#8217; affected in their feelin&#8217;s like I
was. If you ain&#8217;t got no objections I&#8217;ll read her.&#8221; And then,
not waiting to hear any objections, he began:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>The stars are bright to-night;<br /> They surely are a sight,<br />
Sendin&#8217; their flickerin&#8217; light<br /> From an awful, unknown
height.<br /> &#160;<br /> Why do they shine so bright?<br /> I&#8217;m
most o&#8217;ercome with fright&#8213;</p> </div><!-- poetry -->

<p>&#8220;Of course I reely wasn&#8217;t scared,&#8221; he offered with a
deprecatory smile, &#8220;but there wasn&#8217;t any other word that I could
think of just then an&#8217; so I shoved her in. It rhymes anyhow an&#8217; just
about says what I wanted.&#8221;</p>

<p>He resumed:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>When I look up into the night,<br /> An&#8217; see their flickerin&#8217;
light.</p> </div><!-- poetry -->

<p>He ceased and looked at Hollis with an abashed smile. &#8220;It don&#8217;t
seem to sound so good when I&#8217;m readin&#8217; her out loud,&#8221; he
apologized. &#8220;An&#8217; I&#8217;ve thought that mebbe I&#8217;ve worked
that &#8216;night&#8217; an&#8217; &#8216;light&#8217; rhyme over-time. But of course
I&#8217;ve got &#8216;fright&#8217; an&#8217; &#8216;sight&#8217; an&#8217; &#8216;height&#8217;
in there to kind of off-set that.&#8221; He squirmed <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span> in his chair. &#8220;You take her
an&#8217; read her.&#8221; He passed the papers over to Hollis and rose from his
chair. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be goin&#8217; back to the outfit; Norton was
sayin&#8217; that he wanted me to look up some strays an&#8217; I don&#8217;t
want him to be waitin&#8217; for me. But I&#8217;d like to have one of them
pomes printed in the <i>Kicker</i>&#8211;just to show the folks in this here
country that there&#8217;s a real pote in their midst.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8213;&#8221; began Hollis, about to express his surprise over his
guest&#8217;s sudden determination to depart. But he saw Nellie Hazelton
standing just outside the door, and the cause of Ace&#8217;s projected departure
was no longer a mystery. He had gone before Hollis could have finished his
remonstrance, and was fast disappearing in a cloud of dust down the trail when
Hollis turned slowly to see Nellie Hazelton smiling broadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I just couldn&#8217;t resist coming out,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It
rather startled me to discover that there was a real poet in the
country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There seems to be no doubt of it,&#8221; returned Hollis with a smile.
But he immediately became serious. &#8220;Ace means well,&#8221; he added.
&#8220;I imagine that it wasn&#8217;t entirely an ambition to rush into print
that moved him to submit his poems; he wants to help fill up the
paper.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>Miss Hazelton
laughed. &#8220;I really think,&#8221; she said, looking after the departing
poet, &#8220;that he might have been fibbing a little when he said that the
&#8216;night&#8217; had not &#8216;scared&#8217; him. He ran from me,&#8221; she added,
amusement shining in her eyes, &#8220;and I should not like to think that any
woman could appear so forbidding and mysterious as the darkness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis had been scanning one of the poems in his hand. He smiled whimsically
at Miss Hazelton as she concluded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is Ace&#8217;s opinion on that subject,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Since you have doubted him I think it only fair that you should give him
a hearing. Won&#8217;t you read it?&#8221;</p>

<p>She came forward and seated herself in the chair that the poet had vacated,
taking the mass of paper that Hollis passed over to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I read it aloud?&#8221; she asked with a smile at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you had better not,&#8221; he returned; &#8220;it might prove
embarrassing.&#8221;</p>

<p>She blushed and gave her attention to the poem. It was entitled:
&#8220;Woman,&#8221; and ran;</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>&#8220;Woman she dont need no tooter,<br /> be she skule mam or biscut
shooter.<br /> she has most curyus ways about her,<br /> which leads a man

so i say she dont need no tooter<br /> be she skule mam or biscut

eyes an hurt my sole.&#8221;</p> </div><!-- poetry -->

<p>Miss Hazelton laid the manuscript in her lap and laughed heartily.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a harrowing experience!&#8221; she declared. Hollis was grinning
at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a bad thing to have happen to a man,&#8221; he observed;
&#8220;I suppose it rather shattered Ace&#8217;s faith in woman. At least you
could observe by his actions just a moment ago that he isn&#8217;t taking any
more chances.&#8221;</p>

<p>She fixed him with a defiant eye. &#8220;But he still admits that he takes
pleasure in looking at a woman!&#8221; she told him triumphantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;So he does. Still, that isn&#8217;t remarkable. You see, a man
couldn&#8217;t help that&#8211;no matter how badly he had been
treated.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had no reply to make to this, though she <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_186'></a>186</span> gave him a look that he could not mistake. But he
laughed. &#8220;I think Ace&#8217;s effort ought to go into the
<i>Kicker</i>&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have no doubt that many who read the poem
will find in it a great deal of truth&#8211;perhaps a reflection of their own
personal experiences.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her face clouded and she regarded him a little soberly. &#8220;Of your own,
perhaps?&#8221; she suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not guilty,&#8221; he returned laughing. &#8220;You see, I have never
had any time to devote to the study of women, let alone time to allow
them to fool me. Perhaps when I do have time to study them I may find some truth
in Ace&#8217;s effort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then women do not interest you?&#8221; She was looking down the Coyote
trail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, no,&#8221; he said, thinking of the busy days of his past, and
not being aware of the furtive, significant glance she threw toward him.
&#8220;You see, there have always been so many important things to engage my
attention.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How fortunate!&#8221; she said mockingly, after a pause during which
he had time to realize that he had been very ungracious. He saw Ace&#8217;s
manuscript flutter toward him, saw her rise and heard the screen door slam after
her. During the remainder of the afternoon he was left alone on the porch to
meditate upon the evils that arise from thoughtless speech.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span><a id='link_14'></a>CHAPTER XIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE COALITION</span></h2>

<p>Perhaps there were some persons in Union County who, acquainted with the
details of the attack on Hollis, expected to read an account of it in the
<i>Kicker</i>. If there were any such they were disappointed. There was nothing
about the attack printed in the <i>Kicker</i>&#8211;nor did Hollis talk to any
stranger concerning it.</p>

<p>Ace&#8217;s poem entitled &#8220;Woman&#8221; had gone into the paper,
causing the poet&#8211;for many days following the appearance of his
composition&#8211;to look upon his fellow punchers with a sort of condescending
pity. On the second day after his discussion with Miss Hazelton over Ace&#8217;s
poem Hollis returned to the Circle Bar. He had succeeded in convincing Nellie
that he had answered thoughtlessly when he had informed her that he took no
interest in women, and though she had defiantly assured him that she had not
taken offense, there had been a light in her eyes upon his departure which
revealed gratification over his <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_188'></a>188</span> repentance. She stood long on the porch after he
had taken leave of her, watching him as he rode slowly down the trail and
disappeared around a turn. Then she smiled regretfully, sighed, and went into
the house.</p>

<p>Hollis&#8217;s return to the Circle Bar was unostentatious and quite in
keeping with his method of doing things. Within the next few days he met several
of the Circle Bar men and there were mutterings against Dunlavey, but Hollis
discouraged action, assuring the mutterers that his differences with Dunlavey
were entirely personal and that he intended carrying on the fight alone.</p>

<p>His wounds mended rapidly, and within two weeks&#8211;except for the broken
wrist&#8211;he was well as ever. Meanwhile Potter had succeeded in getting the
<i>Kicker</i> out on time, though there had been a noticeable lack of
aggressiveness in the articles. Especially was this true of the articles bearing
upon the situation in Union County. Hollis had dictated some of these, but even
those which he had dictated had seemed to lack something.</p>

<p>Nothing had been heard of Dunlavey&#8211;it seemed that after the attack upon
Hollis he had withdrawn from the scene to await the latter&#8217;s next
move.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>But Hollis was
in no hurry; he had lost some of the enthusiasm that had marked his attitude in
the beginning, but this enthusiasm had been replaced by determination. He was
beginning to realize that in Dunlavey he had met a foe worthy of his most
serious efforts. He had determined that there would be no repetition of the
attack upon him, and therefore during his convalescence he had sent to Las Vegas
for a repeating rifle, and this he carried with him on his trips to and from Dry
Bottom.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the drought continued. The sky was cloudless, the desultory breezes
that swept the plains blighted growing things, raising little whirlwinds of
fine, flinty alkali dust and spreading it over the face of the world. The storm
that had caught Hollis on the Dry Bottom trail had covered only a comparatively
small area; it had lasted only a brief time and after its passage the country
was dry as before.</p>

<p>Rabbit-Ear Creek of all the streams in the vicinity of Dry Bottom held water.
From all points of the compass cattle drifted to the Rabbit-Ear, slaking their
thirst and refusing to leave. Bronzed riders on drooping ponies trailed them,
cutting them out, trying to keep their herds intact, but not succeeding.
Confusion reigned. For miles in both directions Rabbit-Ear <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span> Creek became one huge, long watering
trough. Temporary camps were made; chuck wagons rattled up to them, loaded with
supplies for the cowboys, and rattled back to distant ranches for more. There
had been other droughts, but this one was unexpected&#8211;unprecedented. There
had always been a little water everywhere. Now Rabbit-Ear Creek held all there
was.</p>

<p>Only the small cattle owners suffered because of the drought. Riders told of
the presence of plenty of water in the Canadian, the Cimarron, and the Ute.
Carrizo held some. In fact, nearly all the streams held by the large ranchers
seemed to contain plenty. The smaller owners, whose herds were smaller and whose
complement of punchers was necessarily limited, had apparently been selected by
Providence for ruin.</p>

<p>There were mutterings against the large owners, against Providence.
Particularly were there mutterings against Dunlavey when word came to the owners
of the herds that if the drought was not broken within the next ten days the
Circle Cross manager would drive all foreign cattle from the Rabbit-Ear. He
would not allow his own herds to suffer to save theirs, he said.</p>

<p>On the night following the day upon which the small owners had received this
word from <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span> Dunlavey
a number of the former waited upon Hollis. They found him seated on the lower
gallery of the ranchhouse talking to Norton and Potter. Lemuel Train, of the
Pig-pen outfit, had been selected as their spokesman. He stood before Hollis, a
big man, diffident in manner and rough in appearance, surrounded by his fellow
ranchers, bronzed, bearded, serious of face. Though the sun had been down three
hours the heat was frightful and the visitors shuffled their feet and
uncomfortably wiped the perspiration from their brows.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; invited Hollis. He rose and stood while the men
draped themselves on the edge of the gallery floor&#8211;all except the
spokesman, Lemuel Train. The latter faced Hollis. His face was grim in the
dusk.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve come to see what you&#8217;ve got to say about
water,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Days before Norton had told Hollis that these men who were now herding at the
Rabbit-Ear were the small ranchers who had refused to aid the elder Hollis in
his fight against Dunlavey some years before. Therefore Hollis did not answer at
once. When he did his voice was dry and cold. He too had heard of
Dunlavey&#8217;s ultimatum concerning the water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before I say anything on that subject I <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span> should like to know to whom I am
talking,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Train swept a ponderous hand toward his fellow visitors, pointing them out in
turn. &#8220;There&#8217;s Truxton, of the Diamond Dot; Holcomb, of the Star;
Henningson, of the Three Bar; Yeager, of the Three Diamond; an&#8217; Clark, of
the Circle Y.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Correct,&#8221; affirmed Norton, behind Hollis.</p>

<p>Hollis smiled grimly; he had caught a belligerent note in Norton&#8217;s
voice. Plainly, if the range boss were allowed a voice in the matter, these
visitors would have now received as little encouragement as they had received
from Dunlavey. But Hollis&#8217;s smile showed that he held different views.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Kent Hollis,&#8221; he said to the men; &#8220;I suppose you know
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon we know you,&#8221; said Train; &#8220;you&#8217;re Jim
Hollis&#8217;s boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you know that Dunlavey and my father were not exactly bosom
friends,&#8221; returned Hollis.</p>

<p>Several heads bobbed affirmatively; others sat grimly silent. Hollis
smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;How many of you offered to help my father when he came to you asking
for assistance in his fight against Dunlavey?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>Train fidgeted.
&#8220;I reckon they wasn&#8217;t much chance&#8213;&#8221; he began, and then
hesitated, looking around at his fellows.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; returned Hollis quietly, after an embarrassed pause,
&#8220;there wasn&#8217;t much chance for you to win then. And you had to take a
big risk to help my father. But he had to take a bigger risk to fight alone.
Still he fought. And he fought alone. He was almost ruined. And now you men are
facing ruin. And you have come to Jim Hollis&#8217;s son to help you. Do you
think he ought?&#8221;</p>

<p>The men sat silent; the spokesman was without words.</p>

<p>&#8220;How many men can the six of you muster&#8211;in case Dunlavey should
try to carry out his decision to drive your cattle from the Rabbit-Ear&#8211;or
shoot them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eighteen, I reckon,&#8221; returned Train, looking at the others, who
nodded affirmatively to his question.</p>

<p>Hollis turned to Norton. &#8220;How many men does Dunlavey employ?&#8221; he
questioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thirty,&#8221; snapped Norton. &#8220;But in case he needed them he
c&#8217;n get a hundred.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Big odds,&#8221; smiled Hollis. &#8220;Why should I volunteer to help
you fight Dunlavey? My cattle are certain of getting enough water. Why <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span> should I not be selfish,
as you men were when my father went to you for assistance?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no answer. The faces that surrounded Hollis in the semi-darkness
showed plainly that their owners had given up thoughts of assistance. Grim, hard
lines came into them; two or three sneered. Of course they would fight Dunlavey;
there was no alternative, for they could not stand idly by and see their cattle
slain&#8211;Dunlavey could not drive them from water, they would have to be
shot. They had reckoned on securing help from Hollis; he held one side of the
Rabbit-Ear and with his support they were in a position to make things very
unpleasant for any of Dunlavey&#8217;s men who might, from the opposite side of
the river, attempt to shoot their cattle. But with Hollis against them they
would be powerless; with Hollis against them Dunlavey&#8217;s men could swarm
both sides of the river and the destruction of their cattle would be
certain.</p>

<p>All of the men knew this. Yet they did not answer Hollis&#8217;s question.
They had not come to plead with him; they knew that the situation had narrowed
down to a point where they could depend only on their own resources. They would
not plead, yet as they silently started to file off the gallery there were
bitter smiles on <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
several of their faces. There were no threats; perhaps Hollis had succeeded in
showing them the similarity between his conduct and their own in the long ago,
when his father had gone to them for assistance. At least this was what he had
tried to show them.</p>

<p>Lemuel Train was the last man down the gallery. He turned as he reached the
ground and looked back over his shoulder at Hollis.</p>

<p>&#8220;So-long,&#8221; he said shortly. &#8220;I reckon you&#8217;re even
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis had not moved. &#8220;Wait, Train!&#8221; he said. The visitors halted
and faced him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Men,&#8221; he said quietly, &#8220;you have not answered my question.
I am going to repeat it: Why should I not be selfish, as you men were when my
father went to you for assistance?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lemuel Train smiled ironically. &#8220;Why, I reckon it&#8217;s your trick,
mister man,&#8221; he said; &#8220;you&#8217;ve got all the cards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come back here, men,&#8221; said Hollis. &#8220;Since none of you care
to answer my question I will answer it myself.&#8221; He stood silent while the
men filed back and resumed seats on the gallery edge. Darkness had come on while
he had been talking to the men and inside the ranchhouse Mrs. Norton had lighted
the kerosene lamp and its weak, flickering rays straggled out into the <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span> darkness and upon
Hollis&#8217;s face and the faces of several of the men who sat on the edge of
the gallery.</p>

<p>Hollis knew that he might readily become melodramatic in the few words that
he purposed to say to the men, and so when he began talking he adopted a low,
even tone, confidential, serious. He told them that the things he had written in
his salutatory in the <i>Kicker</i>, months before, had been an honest
declaration of the principles in which he believed. This was America, he
repeated; they were all Americans; they were all entitled to that freedom of
thought, speech, and movement for which their forefathers had fought. For one,
he purposed to fight, if necessary, to retain his rights.</p>

<p>He told them that he held no ill-feeling against them on account of their
refusal to assist his father. That was past history. But now they were to look
into the future; they were all facing ruin if they did not combine in a common
cause. So far as he was concerned their cattle might remain at the Rabbit-Ear
until the drought ended, or until the stream went dry. And if Dunlavey fought
them&#8211;well, he would be with them to the finish.</p>

<p>When he had concluded Lemuel Train stepped forward and shook his hand. The
others followed. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
There was no word spoken. The men filed down from the gallery, sought their
horses, mounted, and rode slowly away into the darkness. When they had gone
Hollis turned to resume his chair, but found Norton standing near him, looking
at him with a curious smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shake!&#8221; said the latter. &#8220;I knowed you&#8217;d do it that
way!&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span><a id='link_15'></a>CHAPTER XV<br /><span class='h2fs'>TO SUPPORT THE LAW</span></h2>

<p>Hollis alone, of all the men whose cattle grazed on the Circle Bar side of
the Rabbit-Ear, really doubted that Dunlavey would have the courage to
inaugurate a war against the small owners. Lemuel Train was particularly strong
in his belief that Dunlavey would not hesitate to shoot whatever cattle
infringed on what he considered were his rights. &#8220;I know the skunk!&#8221;
he declared heatedly to Hollis a day or two after the conversation on the porch
at the Circle Bar. &#8220;He&#8217;ll do it. I&#8217;m only scared that he
won&#8217;t wait till the tenth day before beginnin&#8217;. Why in hell
don&#8217;t it rain?&#8221;</p>

<p>This remained the great, universal interrogation. But at the end of a week it
was unanswered. The sun swam in its endless circles, a great ball of molten
silver at which no man could look with the naked eye, traveling its slow way
through a blurred, white sky, sinking to the horizon in the evening and leaving
a scorched, blasted, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_199'></a>199</span> gasping country behind. The nights brought no
relief. Clark, of the Circle Y, sarcastically declared it to be his belief that
some meddler in things firmamental was paying the owner of the sun to work it
overtime.</p>

<p>Hollis&#8217;s daily twenty mile ride from the Circle Bar to Dry Bottom and
return became a trial to him. At night, when he returned from the trip, hot,
dry, dusty, he would draw a chair out on the gallery floor and scan the sky for
signs of rain. To his recollection since his adventure on the night of the storm
there had not been a cloud in the sky. On the trails the dust was inches deep
and light as a feather. It rose in stifling whirlwinds, filling the nostrils and
the lungs, parching the tongues of man and beast and accentuating the suffering
caused by lack of water.</p>

<p>All the pleasure had been drawn from Hollis&#8217;s rides because of the
dryness and heat. On a morning a week following the day upon which Dunlavey had
issued his warning to the cattle owners, Hollis made his usual trip to Dry
Bottom. Norton accompanied him, intending to make some purchases in town. They
rode the ten miles without incident and Hollis left Norton at the door of the
<i>Kicker</i> office, after telling the range boss to come back to the office
when he had <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span> made
his purchases as he intended returning to the Circle Bar before noon. Hollis
found Potter inside. The latter had remained in Dry Bottom over night and was
busy at a type case when his chief entered. Hollis did not remain long in the
office. He looked over some letters that Potter had placed on his desk, placed
one in a pocket and rose, telling Potter that he would be back and instructing
him to tell Norton to await his coming should the latter return before him. Then
he went down to the court house.</p>

<p>He found the door of Judge Graney&#8217;s court room slightly ajar and
without knocking he pushed it open and entered. On the threshold he halted and
drew a deep breath. Judge Graney was seated at the big table, and directly
opposite him, leaning heavily on his elbows, his face inflamed with anger, sat
Dunlavey. Near a window at the side of the room stood a grave faced man of
medium height, slender and muscular, who was watching the Judge and Dunlavey
soberly.</p>

<p>At Hollis&#8217;s sudden appearance the Judge looked up and smiled, while
Dunlavey faced around, a derisive, mocking grin on his face. Hollis bore no
marks of the recent attack beyond the left wrist, still in splints.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; invited Judge Graney, his smile <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span> growing, his eyes glinting oddly.
&#8220;I think, since you are responsible for the startling innovation which we
have been discussing, that you are entitled to a word.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gravely waved Hollis to a chair and stood silent while the latter sank
into it. Then he smiled, glancing furtively at Dunlavey and addressing
Hollis.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you will remember that some time ago you printed an article in
the <i>Kicker</i> urging upon the Government the necessity of bringing the law
into Union County?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis nodded. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said quietly; &#8220;I
remember.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; resumed the Judge, &#8220;the article has borne fruit.
But perhaps not in the manner you expected.&#8221; He laughed around at the
three, deliberately closing an eye at Hollis. &#8220;You know,&#8221; he
resumed, addressing them all, his eyes twinkling as his gaze met
Dunlavey&#8217;s, &#8220;that the law is an expensive institution. It is a
fundamental principle&#8211;at least of some governments,&#8221; he
smiled&#8211;&#8220;that a community that desires the law must pay, and pay
dearly&#8211;for it. In short, if it wants the law it must pay taxes. I do not
say that that is a principle which our government is applying, but I do say that
it is an eminently fair proposition.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>&#8220;At all
events I have received word from the Interior Department that if we want the law
to come out here we must pay for it. That is not said in so many words, but that
is the inference, if we are to consider the instructions of the Secretary of the
Interior&#8211;which are: &#8216;I am informed that several large ranch owners in
Union County are inclined to evade taxation. Especially is this true&#8211;I am
told&#8211;of a man named Dunlavey, who, if the report is correct, paid, during
the last half year, taxes on five hundred head of cattle, whereas it is claimed
that his holdings will amount to about five thousand, yearly average. In view of
this ridiculously low return it seems incumbent upon me to appoint an
inquisitor, whose duty&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>Dunlavey laughed harshly, interrupting the Judge. Then he turned suddenly to
Hollis, his face inflamed with passion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon this is some of your work?&#8221; he snarled.</p>

<p>Hollis met his gaze steadily. &#8220;I imagine it is,&#8221; he said quietly.
He could not keep a flash of triumph from his eyes. &#8220;Nothing could please
me better than to discover that I had a hand in bringing the law to this
country. It needs plenty of law.&#8221;</p>

<p>Judge Graney cleared his throat. &#8220;This <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_203'></a>203</span> does not apply to you alone, Dunlavey,&#8221; he
said, facing the latter. &#8220;Letters have been sent to every cattleman in
Union County, demanding their appearance before me. The government is determined
to re-adjust conditions out here&#8211;to enforce this new law to the letter.
Beginning on the first of next month,&#8211;September&#8211;which will be the
day after to-morrow, every cattle owner in the county will be required to
register his brand and return a list of his cattle, for taxation. Any owner
refusing to make a fair return on his stock will make a grave mistake. Upon his
failure to make such return the government will seize his stock and dispose of
it to the highest bidder, deducting such an amount as will cover taxes, court
costs, and fines, and returning the remainder, if any, to the owner.&#8221;
Judge Graney faced Hollis. &#8220;I suppose you have received your notification
to that effect?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t paid much attention to my mail since&#8211;since I met
Mr. Dunlavey and several of his friends one night&#8211;some weeks ago.&#8221;
He smiled grimly at Dunlavey, who met his gaze with a derisive grin. &#8220;I
haven&#8217;t been very much interested in anything except getting well,&#8221;
continued Hollis. &#8220;But whether I have been notified or not I shall take
pleasure in complying <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_204'></a>204</span> with the law. I shall have my list ready on
time&#8211;likewise I shall register my brand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dunlavey sneered. &#8220;That won&#8217;t be such an almighty big
job&#8211;counting your steers,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Hollis laughed shortly. &#8220;Perhaps not as big a job as it would have been
had conditions been different,&#8221; he observed dryly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Meaning?&#8221; snapped Dunlavey, stiffening in his chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may draw your own inference,&#8221; drawled Hollis.</p>

<p>For an instant it seemed that Dunlavey contemplated attacking Hollis; he
placed both hands on the table before him, preparatory to rising, evidently
thought better of the idea and sank into the chair again, his eyes flashing
venomously as they met Hollis&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;This country&#8217;s going plum to hell!&#8221; he sneered;
&#8220;when tenderfeet and half-baked lawyers get to running things it will be
time for the cattlemen to pull up stakes and hit the breeze! But I&#8217;m
telling you one thing!&#8221; He banged his fist heavily down upon the table in
front of him and scowled at the Judge, his voice vibrating with passion:
&#8220;You let your damned tenderfoot owners bring in their lists. Mebbe they
don&#8217;t know any better. But I ain&#8217;t bringin&#8217; in no list. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span> It&#8217;s one thing to
pass a law and another thing to enforce it!&#8221; He sat silent for an instant,
glaring at the Judge, who smiled quietly at him, then he turned to Hollis.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been carrying on like you was intending to own this here
country some day,&#8221; he sneered; &#8220;with your damned newspaper and your
lawyer friend here. What we handed you the other night was just a sample of what
you&#8217;ll get if you don&#8217;t hit the breeze out of this country!&#8221;
He got to his feet and stood beside the table, glaring around at the three
men.</p>

<p>For a moment neither of the three spoke. There was a saturnine, almost
mocking, smile on the face of the man who stood at the window. In his expression
one could discover much appreciation of the character of the man at whom he was
looking&#8211;it revealed the fact that he had met such men before&#8211;and
admired them little. There was no fear in the expression, yet had one of the
other men taken the trouble to look at him they would have seen that his right
hand was now lingering very close to the butt of the revolver at his hip.</p>

<p>Judge Graney cleared his throat. The smile was still on his face, but a
sudden brightness of the eyes and a flush in each cheek showed that
Dunlavey&#8217;s defiance had affected him. Both he <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span> and the man at the window watched
closely as Hollis got to his feet and approached Dunlavey.</p>

<p>Hollis&#8217;s face was slightly pale, but there was a steady, unwavering
gleam in his eyes as he walked to within five feet of Dunlavey and stood quietly
beside the table looking at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dunlavey,&#8221; he began slowly, in a soft, even voice, in which
there was not a hint of excitement, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t anything to do with
enforcing the law that seems to have come to Union County. You can defy the law
if you please. But I have something to say in reply to what you have said to me.
It is this: I haven&#8217;t any ambition to own the entire country&#8211;such
talk from a grown man is childish. But I do intend to own the little I&#8217;ve
got in spite of you or anyone else. I am not in the least afraid of you. I owe
you something on account of the other night and some day I am going to thrash
you within an inch of your life!&#8221;</p>

<p>Dunlavey&#8217;s hand fell suggestively to his side. &#8220;There&#8217;s no
time like the present,&#8221; he sneered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I know that you carry a gun,&#8221; said Hollis still
evenly, without excitement; &#8220;most of you folks out here don&#8217;t seem
to be able to get along without one&#8211;it seems to be the fashion. Also, I
might add, every man that carries one seems to yearn to use it. But it has <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span> always seemed to me that
a man who will use a gun without great provocation is a coward!&#8221; He smiled
grimly into Dunlavey&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>For an instant Dunlavey did not move. His eyes glittered malevolently as they
bored into Hollis&#8217;s. Then his expression changed until it was a mingling
of contempt, incredulity, and mockery.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re thinking of thrashing me?&#8221; he sniffed, backing
away a little and eyeing Hollis critically. &#8220;You slugged me once and
you&#8217;re thinking to do it again. And you think that any man who uses a gun
on another is a coward?&#8221; He laughed sardonically. &#8220;Well, all
I&#8217;ve got to say to you is that you ain&#8217;t got your eye-teeth cut
yet.&#8221; He deliberately turned his back on Hollis and the others and walked
to the door. On the threshold he halted, looking back at them all with a
sneering smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know where I live,&#8221; he said to Judge Graney. &#8220;I
ain&#8217;t bringing in no list nor I ain&#8217;t registering my brand. I
don&#8217;t allow no man to come monkeying around on my range and if you come
out there, thinking to run off any of my stock, you&#8217;re doing it at your
own risk!&#8221; His gaze went from the Judge to Hollis and his smile grew
malignant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m saying this to you,&#8221; he said, &#8220;no man <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span> ain&#8217;t ever
thrashed Bill Dunlavey yet and I ain&#8217;t allowing that any man is ever going
to. Put that in your pipe and smoke it!&#8221;</p>

<p>He slammed the door and was gone. Hollis turned from the door to see a dry
smile on the face of the man at the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire eater, ain&#8217;t he?&#8221; observed the latter, as he caught
Hollis&#8217;s glance.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span><a id='link_16'></a>CHAPTER XVI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE BEARER OF GOOD NEWS</span></h2>

<p>Hollis smiled. The Judge got to his feet and approached the two men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hollis,&#8221; he said, &#8220;shake hands with Mr. Allen, of
Lazette.&#8221;</p>

<p>Allen&#8217;s hand came out quickly and was grasped by Hollis&#8217;s, both
grips being hearty and warm.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name&#8217;s Ben Allen,&#8221; explained the stranger with a smile.
&#8220;Tacking on a handle like &#8216;Mister&#8217; would sure make me feel like a
stranger to myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll not quarrel about that,&#8221; remarked the Judge with a
smile; &#8220;we&#8217;ll call you Ben.&#8221; He looked soberly at Hollis,
continuing:</p>

<p>&#8220;Allen has been sent over here from Lazette to assist us in
establishing the law. He was formerly sheriff of Colfax County, having been
defeated by the Cattlemen&#8217;s Association because he refused to become a
party to its schemes. On several occasions since severing his official
connection with Colfax County he has acted in a <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_210'></a>210</span> special capacity for the government. He is an old
acquaintance of the new Secretary of the Interior and much trusted by him. He is
to be the inquisitor mentioned in the letter which I read in the presence of
Dunlavey.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis looked at Allen with a new interest. After noting again the steady,
serene eyes, narrowed always with a slight squint; the firm straight lips, the
well set jaws, Hollis mentally decided that the Secretary of the Interior could
not have made a better choice. Certainly, if he had served as sheriff of Colfax
County, he had had some excellent experiences, for from reading the <i>Lazette
Eagle</i>, Hollis had acquired considerable knowledge of the character of the
inhabitants of Colfax. The editor of the <i>Eagle</i> had many times felicitated
himself upon the fact that his town (Lazette) had not been built ten miles
farther east&#8211;in which case he would have been a resident of
Union&#8211;and ashamed of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we need you,&#8221; said Hollis simply. &#8220;But I imagine
you will have to concentrate your efforts upon one ranch only&#8211;the Circle
Cross. If you make Dunlavey bow to the law you may consider your work
finished.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think Dunlavey will change his views of things shortly,&#8221;
remarked Allen, quietly, but significantly. He smiled at Hollis. &#8220;I have
read <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span> your paper
regularly,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got the editor of our paper
hopping mad&#8211;with your claims about Dry Bottom being superior to Lazette.
Also, you&#8217;ve stirred up the Secretary of the Interior some. I was called
to Washington three weeks ago and invited to tell what I knew of conditions out
here. I didn&#8217;t exaggerate when I told the Secretary that hell was a more
peaceful place for a law loving man to live in. Though,&#8221; he added with a
smile, &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t ever in hell and couldn&#8217;t be positive. I was
just accepting what I&#8217;ve heard preachers say about it. The Secretary asked
me if I knowed you and I told him that though I didn&#8217;t I would be right
glad to if you was doing anything in my line. He laughed and said he&#8217;d
miss his guess if you wasn&#8217;t making things interesting. Told me to get you
to one side and tell you to go to it.&#8221; He smiled dryly. &#8220;According
to what I&#8217;ve read in the <i>Kicker</i> you don&#8217;t need to be told that and
so I&#8217;m keeping my mouth shut.&#8221;</p>

<p>He dropped his humor and spoke seriously, questioning Hollis about the
location of his ranch, listening quietly and attentively to the latter&#8217;s
answers. Half an hour later after having arranged with Judge Graney for the
registering of his brand and the listing of his cattle, Hollis left the court
house and went to his office. In running <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_212'></a>212</span> through his mail he came upon Judge Graney&#8217;s
notification and also another letter, postmarked &#8220;Chicago,&#8221; which
drew a pleased smile to his face. A few minutes later Norton came in, and though
Hollis had done very little on the paper he rose and smilingly announced his
intention of returning to the Circle Bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll take the Coyote trail,&#8221; he informed Norton, after
they had mounted and were riding away from the <i>Kicker</i> office; &#8220;I&#8217;m
stopping for a moment at the Hazelton cabin. Of course,&#8221; he added, seeing
a knowing grin on Norton&#8217;s face, &#8220;I expected you would be
suspicious&#8211;married folks have a habit of adopting a supercilious and
all-wise attitude toward those of us who have been unfortunate enough to remain
in a state of single blessedness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Meanin&#8217; that you&#8217;re some sore because you ain&#8217;t got
hooked up yet?&#8221; grinned Norton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; laughed Hollis. &#8220;But I have been thinking
seriously of trying to reach your altitude.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Girl willin&#8217;?&#8221; queried Norton, as they rode down through a
little gully, then up to a stretch of plain that brought them to the Coyote
trail.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where I am all at sea,&#8221; returned Hollis. He
laughed. &#8220;I suppose you&#8217;ve read Ace&#8217;s poem in the
Kicker?&#8221; He caught Norton&#8217;s <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_213'></a>213</span> nod and continued. &#8220;Well, Ace succeeded in
crowding a whole lot of truth into that effort. Of course you remember the first
couplet:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Woman&#8211;she don&#8217;t need no tooter,<br /> Be she skule
ma&#8217;am or biscut shooter.&#8221;&#8217;</p> </div><!-- poetry -->

<p>he quoted.</p>

<p>&#8220;A woman seems to have an intuitive knowledge of man&#8217;s mental
processes. At least she gauges him pretty well without letting him into the
mystery of how she does it. A man can never tell where he will land.&#8221; Ace
came very near striking the nail on the head when he wrote in the second couplet
that:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>&#8216;She has most curyus ways about her,<br /> Which leads a man to kinda dout
her.&#8217;</p> </div><!-- poetry -->

<p>&#8220;And then, knowing man so well, she absolutely refuses to let him know
anything of her thoughts. Which again, Ace has noted in this manner:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>&nbsp;&#8216;Though lookin&#8217; at her is sure a pleasure;<br /> There
ain&#8217;t no way to get her measure.<br /> &nbsp;I reckon she had man on the
run<br /> A long while before the world begun.&#8217;</p> </div><!-- poetry
-->

<p>&#8220;That seems to be the exact truth,&#8221; he laughed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>Norton grinned
at him. &#8220;You single guys have certa&#8217;nly got a whole lot to
learn,&#8221; he said, &#8220;for a fact. Of course if she&#8217;s any kind of a
woman at all she&#8217;s got him runnin&#8217;. But which way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, toward her, of course!&#8221; laughed Hollis.</p>

<p>Norton&#8217;s smile widened. &#8220;You&#8217;ve tumbled to that,
then,&#8221; he observed dryly. &#8220;Then you&#8217;re ready for the next
lesson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that?&#8221; questioned Hollis.</p>

<p>Norton smiled with ineffable pity. &#8220;Lordy!&#8221; he laughed;
&#8220;you single guys don&#8217;t know a thing not a durned thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>After that they rode on in silence. When they came in sight of the Hazelton
cabin Norton reined in his pony and sat motionless in the saddle, grinning at
Hollis.</p>

<p>&#8220;You run along now,&#8221; he advised. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be
hittin&#8217; her off toward the Dry Bottom trail for the rest of the
way&#8211;I sorta like that trail better anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>He urged his pony off at a tangent and Hollis continued on his way. He found
Nellie alone, her brother having gone out on the range. She came out on the
porch, hearing his pony&#8217;s hoofs on the hard sand and rocks of the trail,
and there was a sincere welcome in her eyes. It was the <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span> first time that he had visited the
cabin since he had returned to the Circle Bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she said delightedly. And then, aware of the sudden light
that had come into Hollis&#8217;s eyes at this evidence of interest, she blushed
and looked down at the hem of her skirt, nervously pushing it out with the toe
of her shoe.</p>

<p>During the days of Hollis&#8217;s convalescence at the Hazelton cabin he had
seen the young woman in many moods. In none of them, however, had she seemed so
attractive as now. Confusion became her, he decided, and he regarded her with a
new interest as he sat on his pony, awaiting her invitation to dismount. It came
presently.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is frightfully hot,&#8221; she said, moving over to where stood two
chairs&#8211;one in which he had passed many hours during the days of his
convalescence, the other in which she had sat quite often&#8211;near him. Not
until now did he realize how full and satisfying those days had been. As he
dismounted and tied his pony to one of the slender porch columns he
smiled&#8211;thinking of Norton&#8217;s question during their discussion of
Ace&#8217;s poem. &#8220;Of course&#8221;&#8211;the range boss had
said&#8211;&#8220;if she&#8217;s any kind of a woman at all she&#8217;s got him
runnin&#8217;. But which way?&#8221; Of course&#8211;literally&#8211;she did not
have him running, but <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_216'></a>216</span> he knew that some uncommon passion had gripped him
and that he was unaccountably pleased.</p>

<p>His smile grew when he remembered her sudden indignation over his thoughtless
statement that women had never interested him. Of course he would not tell her
that he felt a serious interest in <i>one</i> woman. When he dropped into his
favorite chair, removing his hat and mopping the perspiration from his forehead
with his handkerchief, he caught her looking swiftly at the scar under his right
eye&#8211;which would always be a reminder of his experience on the night of the
storm. She saw his brows contract in a frown.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have quite recovered,&#8221; she said; &#8220;except for that
slight scar under the eye you are the same as before the meeting with
Dunlavey&#8217;s men.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked beyond her at the tawny mountains that rose in the
distance,&#8211;miles on the other side of the big basin&#8211;swimming in the
shimmering blur of white sky&#8211;somber guardians of a mysterious world. What
secret did they guard? What did they know of this world of eternal sunlight, of
infinite distance? Did they know as much of the world upon which they frowned as
he knew of the heart of the slender, motherly <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_217'></a>217</span> girl whose eyes betrayed her each time he looked
into them?</p>

<p>A smile that lurked deep within him did not show in his face&#8211;it was
unborn and it gripped him strangely, creating a sensation in his breast that he
could not analyze, but which pleaded to be expressed. He could not express
it&#8211;now. He feared to trust himself and so he fought it down, assuring
himself that it was not yet time. But he knew that he was not the same as before
his experience with Dunlavey on the night of the storm. Something had stolen
into his heart and was enthroned there; something deeper than a mere
scar&#8211;a girl who had mothered him in his extremity; who had hovered over
him, attending to his bruises, binding his wounds, tenderly smoothing his brow
during the days and nights of the fever; attending his wants during
convalescence; erecting a citadel in his heart which would stand as a monument
to his gratitude. No, not gratitude merely. The smile was born. He turned and
looked at her, meeting her eyes fairly, and hers dropped in confusion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think that I am the same as before?&#8221; he asked
suddenly.</p>

<p>She stood up, radiant, pointing a finger toward the Coyote trail. &#8220;Ed
is coming!&#8221; she declared.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>Before he could
say another word she was down off the porch and running toward her brother,
holding his horse while he dismounted, kissing him, patting him lovingly as they
came toward the porch.</p>

<p>The latter greeted Hollis warmly. &#8220;A fellow couldn&#8217;t help but
feel good with a sister like that&#8211;now could he?&#8221; he inquired as he
came upon the porch and took the chair which Nellie had vacated. She had
disappeared into the cabin, not even looking at Hollis, but she could not have
heard Hollis&#8217;s reply had she remained. For it was wordless. There are
times when men understand perfectly without speech.</p>

<p>Hollis stayed for dinner. Nellie was radiantly silent during the meal,
attending to the wants of the two men, listening while they discussed recent
happenings in the county. Ed was much pleased to hear of the coming of Ben
Allen.</p>

<p>&#8220;That guy is business&#8211;through and through,&#8221; he assured
Hollis. &#8220;He was the best sheriff Colfax County ever had&#8211;and
it&#8217;s had some good ones. Allen&#8217;s quiet, but there ain&#8217;t anyone
going to herdride him. Some have tried it, but they found it didn&#8217;t pay
and so they don&#8217;t try it any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>After dinner they went out on the porch for a <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span> smoke, leaving Nellie inside. They
could hear her singing as she washed the dishes. Hazelton smiled as a
particularly happy note reached his ears. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s
got into Sis,&#8221; he said, flashing a swift glance at Hollis. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know as I ever heard her sing that well before.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis made no reply and the conversation turned to the drought&#8211;as all
conversations did during that period. Word had come to Hazelton of
Dunlavey&#8217;s warning to the cattle owners. He had heard also of
Hollis&#8217;s announced intention of taking sides with the small owners.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dunlavey&#8217;s ten days is up the day after tomorrow,&#8221; said
Hazelton. &#8220;If Dunlavey starts anything what are you going to
do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will depend on what Dunlavey starts,&#8221; smiled Hollis.</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m!&#8221; inexpressively grunted Hazelton. He flashed a glance
at the face of the young man beside him, noting the firm mouth, the steady eyes,
and the faint, grim smile. &#8220;H&#8217;m!&#8221; he said again. &#8220;I
suppose you know who you&#8217;re going to give your water to?&#8221; he
questioned.</p>

<p>Hollis nodded. &#8220;To men who refused to help my father when he needed
help,&#8221; he returned.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>Hazelton smiled
oddly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard about that,&#8221; he said. He laughed. &#8220;It
strikes me that I wouldn&#8217;t give such men any water,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>Hollis turned and looked at him, meeting his gaze fairly, and holding it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you would, Hazelton,&#8221; he said, a broad smile on his
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know that?&#8221; queried the latter, slightly defiant.</p>

<p>Hollis motioned toward the kitchen door. &#8220;I know,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;you&#8217;re her brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; began Hazelton
hesitatingly,&#8211;&#8220;I&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>The screen door opened&#8211;slammed, and Nellie Hazelton came out upon the
porch. She had found time to change her morning dress for a soft, fluffy
creation of some sort, and she stood before them, flushing slightly as both
looked at her, a picture that smote Hollis&#8217;s heart with a sudden longing.
Only one glance did she give him and then she was over near Ed&#8217;s chair,
leaning over him, stroking his hair.</p>

<p>For a long time Hollis sat, watching them with sympathetic, appreciative
eyes. Then he thought of the letter in his pocket, the one postmarked
&#8220;Chicago,&#8221; which he had discovered at the <i>Kicker</i> office on
returning from the court <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_221'></a>221</span> house. He drew it from his pocket and read the
legend in the upper left hand corner:</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. J. J. Hammond, &#8213; Hospital, Chicago, Ill.&#8221;</p>

<p>He studied the legend for some little time, his thoughts busy with the
contents of the envelope. Fortunately, his letter to the great physician had
fallen into the hands of the son, Tom Hammond, and the latter, not forgetting
his old schoolmate, had appealed to his father. This was what the surgeon had
written in the letter&#8211;he would not have agreed to accept the case had it
not been for the fact that Hollis had been, and was Tom&#8217;s friend. He would
be pleased if the patient would make the journey to Chicago within a month, that
he might be able to take up his case before entering upon some scientific
investigations which had been deferred a long time, etc.</p>

<p>Hollis had been reading the letter again. He finished it and looked up, to
see Ed and Nellie watching him. He flushed and smiled, holding out the letter to
Nellie.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I found this interesting.
Perhaps you will also find it so.&#8221;</p>

<p>He leaned back with a smile and watched them. But he did not, watch long. He
saw <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span> Nellie start,
saw the color slowly recede from her face, saw her hands clench tightly&#8211;as
she began to read the letter. He turned away, not caring to watch them during
that sacred moment in which they would read the line of hope that the great
surgeon had written. He looked&#8211;it seemed&#8211;for a long time down the
Coyote trail, and when he finally turned his head toward them he saw Ed Hazelton
sitting erect in his chair, apparently stunned by the news. But before him,
close to him, so close that he felt her breath in his face&#8211;her eyes wide
with delight, thankfulness&#8211;and perhaps something more&#8211;Nellie was
kneeling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you, Mr. Hollis!&#8221; she said earnestly, her lips all
a-quiver; &#8220;Thank you, and God bless you!&#8221;</p>

<p>He tried to sit erect; tried to open his lips to tell her that he had done
only what any man would have done under the circumstances. But he moved not, nor
did he speak, for her arms had gone around his shoulders, and her lips were
suddenly pressed firmly and quickly to his. Then he was released and she turned,
crying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come and thank him, Ed!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Ed had taken himself off&#8211;perhaps he did not care to allow anyone to
witness his joy.</p>

<p>Some time during the evening Hollis took his <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_223'></a>223</span> departure from the Hazelton cabin. Ed had come
back, silently taking Hollis&#8217;s hand and gripping it earnestly. And before
Hollis had departed Ed had taken himself into the house. Perhaps he divined that
there were other&#8217;s joys beside his.</p>

<p>That night before retiring Nellie stole softly into her brother&#8217;s room
and kissed him lightly on the forehead. That same night also Hollis rode up to
the Circle Bar corral gate&#8211;singing. Norton and Potter were sitting on the
gallery, waiting for him. While Hollis was removing the saddle from his pony
Norton rose from his chair and smiled at Potter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said to the latter, &#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to
bed.&#8221; He moved a few steps toward the door and then turned and looked back
at Potter, who had also risen. He laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, Potter,&#8221; he said. Then he quoted:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>&#8220;Woman&#8211;she don&#8217;t need no tooter<br /> Be she skule
ma&#8217;am or biscuit shooter.&#8221;</p> </div><!-- poetry -->

<p>He hesitated and looked again at Potter. &#8220;Why,&#8221; said the latter,
puzzled, &#8220;that&#8217;s from Ace&#8217;s poem!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; laughed Norton; &#8220;that&#8217;s just what it
is!&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span><a id='link_17'></a>CHAPTER XVII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE RUSTLER</span></h2>

<p>The following day Hollis rode to town over the Dry Bottom trail. Had he
followed a perfectly natural inclination he would have taken the Coyote, for it
would have brought him to the Hazelton cabin. But he succeeded in forcing
himself to go the other way, arguing that Nellie and her brother might wish to
be alone to consider the great good fortune that had come upon them.</p>

<p>And so they did, though had Hollis appeared to them this morning as they sat
upon the porch he would have been assured of a royal welcome. Indeed, during the
early morning hours Nellie had cast many furtive, expectant glances down the
Coyote trail. When eight o&#8217;clock came and Hollis did not appear she gave
him up.</p>

<p>The dawn found her kneeling beside her brother&#8217;s bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ed!&#8221; she said, leaning over him, waking <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span> him, her eyes alight with joy;
&#8220;Ed, he says you can be cured!&#8221;</p>

<p>He struggled and sat up, rubbing his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gosh, sis!&#8221; he said in an awed voice. &#8220;Then it&#8217;s
true! I was afraid I&#8217;d been dreaming!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is no dream,&#8221; she returned ecstatically; &#8220;it is
reality&#8211;beautiful reality! Wasn&#8217;t it simply <i>great</i> of him to
take such an interest in us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Us?&#8221; grinned Ed, noting her crimson, happy face. &#8220;Well,
mebbe he did it for <i>us</i>,&#8221; he added subtly, &#8220;but I take it
I&#8217;ve got a right to have another opinion on that.&#8221;</p>

<p>She fled from him without answering and a little later he heard her singing
as she prepared breakfast. After the meal Ed made a short trip out into the
basin to look after his cattle and then returned to the cabin. Sitting on the
porch he and Nellie devoted several hours to a grave discussion of the
situation. They discovered that it had a serious side.</p>

<p>In the first place there was the dangerous nature of the operation. Here Ed
laughed away his sister&#8217;s fears by assuring her that he had an excellent
constitution and that since the fall from the pony had not killed him he was in
no danger from the knife. If Nellie entertained any doubt of this she wisely
remained silent, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
though Ed could see that she was not entirely reassured. He swept away her last
objection to this forbidding feature when he told her that he preferred taking
the risk to living in constant dread of a recurrence of an acute attack of his
malady&#8211;such as he had experienced when he had attacked Hollis in
Devil&#8217;s Hollow.</p>

<p>There were many other things to be discussed&#8211;chiefly the care of the
cattle and the cabin during his absence in Chicago. He would not listen to her
suggestion to accompany him&#8211;he would prefer to have her remain at the
cabin. Or he would try to arrange with Hollis for her to stay at the Circle Bar.
There she would have Mrs. Norton for a companion, and she might ride each day to
the cabin. He was certain that Hollis would arrange to have his men care for the
cattle. He assured her that he would settle that question with Hollis when the
latter passed the cabin that night on his return to the Circle Bar. Of course
Hollis would take the Coyote trail to-night, he insinuated, grinning hugely at
the blushes that reached her face.</p>

<p>But Hollis did not pass the cabin that night. He had taken the Dry Bottom
trail on his return to the Circle Bar.</p>

<p>He had accomplished very little that day on account of the heat&#8211;and a
certain vision that <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_227'></a>227</span> had troubled him&#8211;taking his mind off his work
and projecting it to a little cabin in a small basin, to a porch where sat a
girl&#8211;the girl of his vision. She had voluntarily kissed him. Had it been
all on account of gratitude? Of course&#8211;though&#8211;Well, memory of the
kiss still lingered and he was willing to forgive her the slight lapse of
modesty because he had been the recipient.</p>

<p>There had been one interesting development in Dry Bottom during the day. All
day the town had swarmed with ranch owners who had come in to the court
house to list their cattle for taxation and register their brands. Shortly after
noon Ben Allen had dropped into the <i>Kicker</i> office with the news that
every owner in the county with the exception of Dunlavey had responded to the
law&#8217;s demands.</p>

<p>To Hollis&#8217;s inquiry regarding the course he would pursue in forcing
Dunlavey to comply with the law, Allen remarked with a smile that there was
&#8220;plenty of time.&#8221; He had had much experience with men of the
Dunlavey type.</p>

<p>Potter and Hollis exchanged few words during the ride to the Circle Bar. The
heat&#8211;the eternal, scorching, blighting heat&#8211;still continued; the
dust had become an almost unbearable irritation. During the trip to the ranch
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span> the two men came
upon an arroyo over which Hollis had passed many times. At a water hole where he
had often watered his horse they came upon several dead steers stretched prone
in the green slime. The water had disappeared; the spring that had provided it
had dried and there was nothing to tell of it except a small stretch of damp
earth, baking in the sun. The steers were gaunt, lanky creatures, their hides
stretched tight as drum-heads over their ribs, their tongues lolling out, black
and swollen, telling mutely of their long search for water and their suffering.
Coyotes had been at work on them; here lay a heap of bare bones; there a skull
glistened in the white sunlight.</p>

<p>A few miles farther on they came upon one of the punchers from the Circle Y
with a calf thrown over the saddle in front of him. He was driving several
gaunt, drooping cattle toward the Rabbit-Ear. The calf bellowed piteously at
sight of Hollis and Potter. The puncher hailed them.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re Hollis, of the Circle Bar, ain&#8217;t you?&#8221; he
said when the latter had spurred his pony close to him. At Hollis&#8217;s nod he
grinned ironically. &#8220;Hot!&#8221; he said, coming quickly to the universal
topic of conversation; &#8220;I reckon this wouldn&#8217;t be called hot in some
places&#8211;in hell, for instance. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_229'></a>229</span> Say,&#8221; he said as he saw Hollis&#8217;s lips
straighten, &#8220;to-morrow the ten days is up. Mebbe it&#8217;ll be hotter
then. The damned skunk!&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course he referred to Dunlavey&#8211;the latter&#8217;s threat to drive
all foreign cattle from the Rabbit-Ear had been carried far and wide by
riders&#8211;the whole country knew of it. There had been much condemnation and
some speculation, but there was nothing to be done until after the tenth day.
Even then much depended upon Hollis&#8217;s attitude. Would he make war upon
Dunlavey in defense of the men who had refused aid to his father in time of
need?</p>

<p>Hollis was still of the opinion that Dunlavey would not attempt to carry out
his threat. He smiled at the malevolent expression in the puncher&#8217;s
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somehow,&#8221; he said quietly, &#8220;I have always been able to
distinguish between empty boast and determination. Dunlavey has done some
foolish things, no doubt, and is doing a foolish thing in defying the law, but I
don&#8217;t anticipate that he will do anything quite so rash as to further
antagonize the small owners.&#8221;</p>

<p>The puncher sat erect and laughed harshly. &#8220;You don&#8217;t?&#8221; he
inquired in an over-gentle, polite voice. &#8220;Mister Hollis,&#8221; he added,
as the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span> latter
looked quickly at him, &#8220;you ain&#8217;t heard nothin&#8217; from the
Circle Bar to-day, I reckon?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis&#8217;s answer was negative. The Circle Y man&#8217;s face grew
suddenly serious. &#8220;You ain&#8217;t! Well, then, that&#8217;s the reason
you&#8217;re talkin&#8217; so. The last I heard from the Circle Bar was that
Norton an&#8217; some of your men had captured one of Dunlavey&#8217;s
men&#8211;Greasy&#8211;rebrandin&#8217; some Circle Bar steers an&#8217; was
gettin&#8217; ready to string him up. I reckon mebbe you&#8217;d call that
doin&#8217; somethin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis straightened. He had suddenly forgotten the heat, the dust, and the
problem of water.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long ago did you hear this?&#8221; he demanded sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Bout an hour ago,&#8221; returned the Circle Y man. &#8220;I was
rustlin&#8217; up these strays down in the basin an&#8217; headin&#8217; them
toward the crick when I runs plum into a man from the Three Bar outfit. He was
plum excited over it. Said they&#8217;d ketched Greasy down by the Narrows
sometime after noon an&#8217;&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>But the Circle Y man finished to the empty air for Hollis&#8217;s pony had
leaped forward into a cloud of dust, running desperately.</p>

<p>The Circle Y man sat erect, startled. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll
be&#8213;&#8221; he began, speaking to Potter. But <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span> the printer was following his chief and
was already out of hearing. &#8220;Now what do you suppose&#8213;&#8221; again
began the Circle Y man, and then fell silent, suddenly smitten with the
uselessness of speech. He yelled at his gaunt steers and shifted the calf in
front of him to a more comfortable position. Then he proceeded on his way. But
as he rode his lips curled, his eyes narrowed, and speech again returned to him.
&#8220;Now why in hell would a man get so damned excited over hearin&#8217; that
someone was goin&#8217; to string up a measly rustler?&#8221;</p>

<p>The interrogation remained unanswered. The Circle Y man continued on his way,
watching the fast disappearing dust clouds on the Circle Bar trail.</p>

<p>When Hollis reached the Circle Bar ranchhouse there was no one about. He rode
up to the front gallery and dismounted, thinking that perhaps Norton would be in
the house. But before he had crossed the gallery Mrs. Norton came to the door.
She was pale and laboring under great excitement, but instantly divined
Hollis&#8217;s errand.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve taken him down to the cottonwood&#8221; she told Hollis,
pointing toward the grove in which Hollis had tried the six-shooter that Norton
had given him the first day after his <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_232'></a>232</span> arrival at the ranch. &#8220;They are going to hang
him! Hurry!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis was back in the saddle in an instant and racing his pony down past the
bunk house at break-neck speed. He urged the little animal across an intervening
stretch of plain, up a slight rise, down into a shallow valley, and into the
cottonwood, riding recklessly through the trees and urging the pony at a
headlong pace through the underbrush&#8211;crashing it down, scaring the
rattlers from their concealment, and startling the birds from their lofty
retreats.</p>

<p>For ten minutes he rode as he had never ridden before. And then he came upon
them. They stood at the base of a fir-balsam, whose gnarled limbs spread flatly
outward&#8211;three Circle Bar men, a half dozen from the various outfits whose
herds grazed his range, and the rustler&#8211;Greasy&#8211;a rope knotted about
his neck, standing directly under one of the out-spreading limbs of the tree,
his head bowed, but his face wearing a mocking, defiant grin. The rope had been
thrown over the limb and several men were holding it, preparatory to drawing it
taut. Norton was standing near, his face pale, his lips straight and grim with
determination. Apparently Hollis had arrived just in time.</p>

<p>None of the men moved from their places <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_233'></a>233</span> when Hollis dismounted, but all looked at him as
though expecting him to express approval of what they were about to do. Several
lowered their gaze with embarrassment when they saw that he did not approve.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is all this about, Norton?&#8221; he asked, speaking to the
latter, who had stepped forward and now stood beside Greasy. Whatever excitement
had resulted from the sudden discovery that his men had captured a rustler and
were about to hang him, together with the strain of his hard ride to the
cottonwood, had disappeared, and Hollis&#8217;s voice was quiet as he addressed
his range boss.</p>

<p>Norton smiled grimly. &#8220;We were roundin&#8217; up a few strays just the
other side of the Narrows this morning, and Ace and Weary were workin&#8217;
down the river. In that little stretch of gully just the other side of the
Narrows they came upon this sneak brandin&#8217; two of our beeves through a
piece of wet blanket. He&#8217;d already done it an&#8217; so we ketched him
with the goods. It&#8217;s the first time we&#8217;ve ever been able to lay a
hand on one of Dunlavey&#8217;s pluguglies, an&#8217; we was figgerin&#8217; on
makin&#8217; an example of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis met Norton&#8217;s grim gaze and smiled. &#8220;I want to thank
you&#8211;all of you, for guarding my interests so zealously,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;There is <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span> no
doubt that this man richly deserves hanging&#8211;that is, of course, according
to your code of ethics. I understand that is the way things have been done
heretofore. But I take it none of you want to make me appear
ridiculous?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure not,&#8221; came several voices in chorus.</p>

<p>Hollis laughed. &#8220;But you took the surest way of making me appear
so,&#8221; he returned.</p>

<p>He saw Norton&#8217;s face flush and he knew that the latter had already
grasped the significance of his words. But the others, simpler of mind,
reasoning by no involved process, looked at him, plainly puzzled. He would have
to explain more fully to them. He did so. When he had shown them that in hanging
the rustler he would be violating the principle that he had elected to defend,
they stood before him abashed, thoroughly disarmed. All except Ace. The
poet&#8217;s mind was still active.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon you might say you didn&#8217;t know nothin&#8217; about us
hangin&#8217; him?&#8221; he suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I might,&#8221; returned Hollis. &#8220;But people would not think
so. And there is my conscience. It wouldn&#8217;t be such a weight upon
it&#8211;the hanging of this man; I believe I would enjoy standing here and
watching him stretch your rope. But I would not be able to reconcile the action
with the principle for which I am fighting. I believe <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span> none of you men would trust me very
much if I advocated the law one day and broke it the next. The application of
this principle would be much the same as if I stole a horse to-day and to-morrow
had you arrested for stealing one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; they chorused, and fell silent, regarding him
with a new interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what are you goin&#8217; to do with the cuss?&#8221; queried one
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have a sheriff in Dry Bottom, I expect?&#8221; questioned
Hollis.</p>

<p>Grins appeared on the faces of several of the men; the prisoner&#8217;s face
lighted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said one; &#8220;I reckon Bill Watkins is the sheriff
all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll take him to Bill Watkins,&#8221; decided Hollis.</p>

<p>The grins on the faces of several of the men grew. Norton laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon you ain&#8217;t got acquainted with Bill yet, Hollis,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Bill owes his place to Dunlavey. There has never been a rustler
convicted by Watkins yet. I reckon there won&#8217;t ever be any
convicted&#8211;unless he&#8217;s been caught stealin&#8217; Dunlavey&#8217;s
cattle. Bill&#8217;s justice is a joke.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis smiled grimly. He had learned that much from Judge Graney. He did not
expect <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span> to secure
justice, but he wished to have something tangible upon which to work to force
the law into the country. His duty in the matter consisted only in delivering
the prisoner into the custody of the authorities, which in this case was the
sheriff. The sheriff would be held responsible for him. He said this much to the
men. There was no other lawful way.</p>

<p>He was not surprised that they agreed with him. They had had much experience
in dealing with Dunlavey; they had never been successful with the old methods of
warfare and they were quite willing to trust to Hollis&#8217;s judgment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon you&#8217;re just about right,&#8221; said one who had spoken
before. &#8220;Stringin&#8217; this guy up would finish him all right. But that
wouldn&#8217;t settle the thing. What&#8217;s needed is to get it fixed up for
good an&#8217; all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Correct!&#8221; agreed Hollis; &#8220;you&#8217;ve got it exactly. We
might hang a dozen men for stealing cattle and we could go on hanging them.
We&#8217;ve got no right to hang anyone&#8211;we&#8217;ve got a law for that
purpose. Then let us make the law act!&#8221;</p>

<p>The prisoner had stood in his place, watching the men around him, his face
betraying varying emotions. When it had been finally agreed to take him to Dry
Bottom and deliver him over to <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_237'></a>237</span> the sheriff he grinned broadly. But he said nothing
as they took the rope from around his neck, forced him to mount a horse and
surrounding him, rode out of the cottonwood toward the Circle Bar
ranchhouse.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span><a id='link_18'></a>CHAPTER XVIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE TENTH DAY</span></h2>

<p>Dusk had fallen by the time Greasy had been brought to the bunkhouse, and
Mrs. Norton had lighted the kerosene lamps when Norton and Hollis, assured of
the safety of the prisoner, left the bunkhouse and went into the house for
supper. Potter had washed the dust of travel from him and when Norton and Hollis
arrived he was seated on the porch, awaiting them. Mrs. Norton greeted them with
a smile. Her eyes expressed gratitude as they met Hollis&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so glad you were in time,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I told Neil not
to do it, but he was determined and wouldn&#8217;t listen to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might have tried &#8216;bossing&#8217; him,&#8221; suggested Hollis,
remembering his range boss&#8217;s words on the occasion of his first meeting
with Norton&#8217;s wife. He looked straight at Norton, his eyes narrowing
quizzically. &#8220;You know you told me once that&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mebbe I was stretchin&#8217; things a little when <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span> I told you that,&#8221; interrupted
Norton, grinning shamelessly. &#8220;If a man told the truth all the time
he&#8217;d have a hard time keepin&#8217; ahead of a woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Woman&#8211;she don&#8217;t need no tooter,&#8217;&#8221; quoted
Hollis. &#8220;It has taken you a long time to discover what Ace has apparently
known for years. And Ace is only a bachelor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Norton&#8217;s eyes lighted. &#8220;You&#8217;re gettin&#8217; back at me for
what I said to you the day before yesterday&#8211;when you stopped off at
Hazelton&#8217;s,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;All the same you&#8217;ll know more
about women when you&#8217;ve had more experience with them. When I told you
that I&#8217;d been &#8216;bossed,&#8217; I didn&#8217;t mean that I&#8217;d been
bossed regular. No woman that knows just how much she can run a man ever lets
him know that she&#8217;s bossin&#8217; him. Mebbe she&#8217;ll act like
she&#8217;s lettin&#8217; him have his own way. But she&#8217;s bossin&#8217;
him just the same. He sort of likes it, I reckon. At least it&#8217;s only when
a man gets real mad that he does a little bossin&#8217; on his own account. And
then, like as not, he&#8217;ll find that he&#8217;s made a big mistake. Like I
did to-day about hangin&#8217; Greasy, for instance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis bowed gravely to Mrs. Norton. &#8220;I think he ought to be forgiven,
Mrs. Norton,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Day before yesterday he presumed to <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span> lecture me on the
superiority of the married male over the unmarried one. And now he humbly admits
to being bossed. What then becomes of his much talked of superiority? Shall
I&#8211;free and unbossed&#8211;admit inferiority?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Norton smiled wisely as she moved around the table, arranging the
dishes. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t decide that,&#8221; she said, &#8220;until it is
explained to me why so many men are apparently so eager to engage a
boss.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon that settles that argument!&#8221; gloated Norton.</p>

<p>Had this conversation taken place two months before Hollis might have
answered, Why, indeed, were men so eager to engage a boss? Two months before he
might have answered cynically, remembering the unhappiness of his parents. That
he did not answer now showed that he was no longer cynical; that he had
experienced a change of heart.</p>

<p>Of course Mrs. Norton knew this&#8211;Norton must have told her. He could
appreciate the subtle mockery that had suggested the question, but he did not
purpose to allow Norton to sit there and enjoy the confusion that was sure to
overtake him did he attempt to continue the argument with Mrs. Norton. He was
quite certain that Norton anticipated such an outcome.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>&#8220;Perhaps
Norton can answer that?&#8221; he suggested mildly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t no good at guessin&#8217; riddles,&#8221; jeered Norton.
&#8220;But I reckon you know&#8211;if you wanted to tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Hollis did not tell, and the conversation shifted to other subjects.
After supper they went out upon the porch. A slight breeze had sprung up with
the dusk, though the sky was still cloudless. At ten o&#8217;clock, when they
retired, the breeze had increased in velocity, sighing mournfully through the
trees in the vicinity of the ranchhouse, though there was no perceptible change
in the atmosphere&#8211;it seemed that the wind was merely shifting the heat
waves from one point to another.</p>

<p>&#8220;A good, decent rain would save lots of trouble to-morrow,&#8221; said
Norton as he and Hollis stood on the porch, taking a last look at the sky before
going to bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really think Dunlavey will carry out his threat?&#8221;
questioned Hollis. &#8220;Somehow I can&#8217;t help but think that he was
bluffing when he said it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He don&#8217;t do much bluffin&#8217;,&#8221; declared Norton.
&#8220;At least he ain&#8217;t done much up to now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there is plenty of water in the Rabbit-Ear,&#8221; <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span> returned Hollis;
&#8220;plenty for all the cattle that are here now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Norton flashed a swift glance at him. &#8220;That&#8217;s because you
don&#8217;t know this country,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Four years ago we had a
dry spell. Not so bad as this, but bad enough. The Rabbit-Ear held up good
enough for two months. Then she went dry sudden. There wasn&#8217;t water enough
in her to fill a thimble. I reckon you ain&#8217;t been watchin&#8217; her for
the last day or so?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis admitted that he had not seen the river within that time. Norton
laughed shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s dry in spots now,&#8221; he informed Hollis. &#8220;There
ain&#8217;t any water at all in the shallows. It&#8217;s tricklin&#8217; through
in some places, but mostly there&#8217;s nothin&#8217; but water holes an&#8217;
dried, baked mud. In two days more, if it don&#8217;t rain, there won&#8217;t be
water enough for our own stock. Then what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There will be water for every steer on the range as long as it
lasts,&#8221; declared Hollis grimly. &#8220;After that we&#8217;ll all take our
medicine together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; declared Norton. &#8220;That&#8217;s what I expected of
you. But I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s goin&#8217; to work out that way. Weary
was ridin&#8217; the Razor Back this mornin&#8217; and he says he saw Dunlavey
an&#8217; Yuma and some more Circle Cross guys <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_243'></a>243</span> nosin&#8217; around behind some brush on the other
side of the creek. They all had rifles.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis&#8217;s face paled slightly. &#8220;Where are the other
men&#8211;Train and the rest?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Down on Razor Back,&#8221; Norton informed him; &#8220;they sneaked
down there after Weary told me about seein&#8217; Dunlavey on the other side.
Likely they&#8217;re scattered by now&#8211;keepin&#8217; an eye out for
trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; decided Hollis, &#8220;there isn&#8217;t any use of
looking for it. It finds all of us soon enough. To-morrow is the tenth day and I
am sure that if Dunlavey carries out his threat he won&#8217;t start anything
until to-morrow. Therefore I am going to bed.&#8221; He laughed. &#8220;Call me
if you hear any shooting. I may want to take a hand in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>They parted&#8211;Hollis going to his room and Norton stepping down off the
porch to take a turn down around the pasture to look after the horses.</p>

<p>Hollis was tired after his experiences of the day and soon dropped off to
sleep. It seemed that he had been asleep only a few minutes, however, when he
felt a hand shaking him, and a voice&#8211;Norton&#8217;s voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hollis!&#8221; said the range boss. &#8220;Hollis! Wake up!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>Hollis sat
erect, startled into perfect wakefulness. He could not see Norton&#8217;s face
in the dark, but he swung around and sat on the edge of the bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;Have they
started?&#8221;</p>

<p>He heard Norton laugh, and there was satisfaction in the laugh.
&#8220;Started?&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;Well, I reckon something&#8217;s
started. Listen!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis listened. A soft patter on the roof, a gentle sighing of the wind, and
a distant, low rumble reached his ears. He started up. &#8220;Why, it&#8217;s
raining!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Norton chuckled. &#8220;Rainin&#8217;!&#8221; he chirped joyously.
&#8220;Well, I reckon it might be called that by someone who didn&#8217;t know
what rain is. But I&#8217;m tellin&#8217; you that it ain&#8217;t
rainin&#8217;&#8211;it&#8217;s pourin&#8217;! It&#8217;s a cloud-burst,
that&#8217;s what it is!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis did not answer. He ran to the window and stuck his head out. The rain
came against his head and shoulders in stinging, vicious slants. There was
little lightning, and what there was seemed distant, as though the storm covered
a vast area. He could dimly see the pasture&#8211;the horses huddled in a corner
under the shelter that had been erected for them; he could see the tops of the
trees in the cottonwood grove&#8211;bending, twisting, leaning from the wind;
the bunkhouse <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span> door
was open, a stream of light illuminating a space in which stood several of the
cowboys. Some were attired as usual, others but scantily, but all were outside
in the rain, singing, shouting, and pounding one another in an excess of joy.
For half an hour Hollis stood at the window, watching them, looking out at the
storm. There was no break anywhere in the sky from horizon to horizon. Plainly
there was to be plenty of rain. Convinced of this he drew a deep breath of
satisfaction, humor moving him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do hope Dunlavey and his men don&#8217;t get wet.&#8221; he said. He
went to his trousers and drew forth his watch. He could not see the face of it
and so he carried it to the window. The hands pointed to fifteen minutes after
one. &#8220;It&#8217;s the tenth day,&#8221; he smiled. &#8220;Dunlavey might
have saved himself considerable trouble in the future if he had placed a little
trust in Providence&#8211;and not antagonized the small owners. I don&#8217;t
think Providence has been looking out for my interests, but I wonder who will
stand the better in the estimation of the people of this county&#8211;Dunlavey
or me?&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled again, sighed with satisfaction, and rolled into bed. For a long
time he lay, listening to the patter of the rain on the roof, and then dropped
off to sleep.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span><a id='link_19'></a>CHAPTER XIX<br /><span class='h2fs'>HOW A RUSTLER ESCAPED</span></h2>

<p>When Hollis got out of bed at six o&#8217;clock that same morning he heard
surprising sounds outside. Slipping on his clothes he went to the window and
looked out. Men were yelling at one another, screeching delightful oaths,
capering about hatless, coatless, in the rain that still came steadily down. The
corral yard was a mire of sticky mud in which the horses reared and plunged in
evident appreciation of the welcome change from dry heat to lifegiving moisture.
Riderless horses stood about, no one caring about the saddles, several calves
capered awkwardly in the pasture. Norton&#8217;s dog&#8211;about which he had
joked to Hollis during the latter&#8217;s first ride to the Circle Bar&#8211;was
yelping joyously and running madly from one man to another.</p>

<p>Norton himself stood down by the door of the bunkhouse, grinning with
delight. Near him stood Lemuel Train, and several of the other <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span> small ranchers whose
stock had grazed for more than two weeks on the Circle Bar range without
objection from Hollis. They saw him and motioned for him to come down, directing
original oaths at him for sleeping so late on so &#8220;fine a
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>He dressed hastily and went down. They all ate breakfast in the mess house,
the cook being adjured to &#8220;spread it on for all he was
worth&#8221;&#8211;which he did. Certainly no one left the mess house hungry.
During the meal Lemuel Train made a speech on behalf of himself and the other
owners who had enjoyed Hollis&#8217;s hospitality, assuring him that they were
&#8220;with him&#8221; from now on. Then they departed, each going his separate
way to round up his cattle and drive them back to the home ranch.</p>

<p>The rain continued throughout the day and far into the night. The dried,
gasping country absorbed water until it was sated and then began to shed it off
into the arroyos, the gullies, the depressions, and the river beds. Every hollow
overflowed with it; it seemed there could never be another drought.</p>

<p>Before dawn on the following day all the small ranchers had departed. Several
of them, on their way to their home ranches, stopped off at the Circle Bar to
shake hands with Hollis and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_248'></a>248</span> assure him of their appreciation. Lemuel Train did
not forget to curse Dunlavey.</p>

<p>&#8220;We ain&#8217;t likely to forget how he stood on the water
proposition,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>After Train had departed Norton stood looking after him. Then he turned and
looked at Hollis, his eyes narrowing quizzically. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got in
right with that crowd,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Durned if I don&#8217;t believe
you knowed all the time that it was goin&#8217; to rain before Dunlavey&#8217;s
tenth day was over!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis smiled oddly. &#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; he returned; &#8220;there is no
law, moral or otherwise, to prevent a man from looking a little
ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>After breakfast Hollis gave orders to have Greasy prepared for travel, and an
hour later he and the range boss, both armed with rifles, rode out of the corral
yard with Greasy riding between them and took the Dry Bottom trail.</p>

<p>The earth had already dried; the trail was hard, level, and dustless, and
traveling was a pleasure. But neither of the three spoke a word to one another
during the entire trip to Dry Bottom. Greasy bestrode his horse loosely,
carelessly defiant; Norton kept a watchful eye on him, and Hollis rode steadily,
his gaze fixed thoughtfully on the trail.</p>

<p>At ten o&#8217;clock they rode into Dry Bottom.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span> There were not many persons about, but
those who were gave instant evidence of interest in the three by watching them
closely as they rode down the street to the sheriff&#8217;s office, dismounted,
and disappeared inside.</p>

<p>The sheriff&#8217;s office was in a little frame shanty not over sixteen feet
square, crude and unfinished. There were a front and back door, two
windows&#8211;one in the side facing the court house, the other in the front.
For furniture there were a bench, two chairs, some shelves, a cast iron stove, a
wooden box partly filled with saw-dust which was used as a cuspidor, and a rough
wooden table which served as a desk. In a chair beside the desk sat a tall,
lean-faced man, with a nose that suggested an eagle&#8217;s beak, with its high,
thin, arched bridge, little, narrowed, shifting eyes, and a hard mouth whose
lips were partly concealed under a drooping, tobacco-stained mustache. He turned
as the three men entered, leaning back in his chair, his legs a-sprawl,
motioning them to the chairs and the bench. They filed in silently. Greasy
dropped carelessly into one of the chairs, Norton took another near him, but
Hollis remained standing.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are the sheriff, I suppose?&#8221; inquired the latter.</p>

<p>The official spat copiously into the wooden box <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span> without removing his gaze from the
three visitors.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; he returned shortly, his voice coming with a truculent
snap. &#8220;You wantin&#8217; the sheriff?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis saw a swift, significant glance pass between him and Greasy and he
smiled slightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he returned quietly; &#8220;we want you. We are delivering
this man into your custody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he done?&#8221; demanded the sheriff.</p>

<p>&#8220;I charge him with stealing two of my steers,&#8221; returned Hollis.
&#8220;Several of my men discovered him at work the day before yesterday
and&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on a minute now!&#8221; interrupted the sheriff.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s git this thing goin&#8217; accordin&#8217; to the law.&#8221;
He spat again into the wooden box, cocked his head sideways and surveyed Hollis
with a glance in which there was much insolence and contempt. &#8220;Who might
you be?&#8221; he questioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Hollis,&#8221; returned the latter quietly, his eyes
meeting the other&#8217;s steadily. &#8220;I own the Circle Bar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m!&#8221; The sheriff crossed his legs and stuck his thumbs
into the arm-holes of his vest, revealing a nickle-plated star on the lapel of
the latter. &#8220;H&#8217;m. Your name&#8217;s Hollis, an&#8217; you <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span> own the Circle Bar.
Seems I&#8217;ve heard of you.&#8221; He squinted his eyes at Hollis.
&#8220;You&#8217;re Jim Hollis&#8217;s boy, ain&#8217;t you?&#8221; His eyes
flashed with a sudden, contemptuous light. &#8220;Tenderfoot, ain&#8217;t you?
Come out here to try an&#8217; show folks how to run things?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis&#8217;s face slowly paled. He saw Greasy grinning. &#8220;I suppose it
makes little difference to you what I am or what I came out here for,&#8221; he
said quietly; &#8220;though, if I were to be required to give an opinion I
should say that there is room for improvement in this county in the matter of
applying its laws.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sheriff laughed harshly. &#8220;You&#8217;ll know more about this country
after you&#8217;ve been here a while,&#8221; he sneered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mebbe he&#8217;ll know more about how to run a law shebang,
too,&#8221; dryly observed Norton, &#8220;after he&#8217;s watched Bill Watkins
run her a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t reckon anyone ast you to stick your gab in this here
affair?&#8221; demanded the sheriff of Norton.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; returned Norton, drawling, &#8220;no one asked me. But
while we&#8217;re handin&#8217; out compliments we might as well all have a hand
in it. It strikes me that when a man&#8217;s runnin&#8217; a law shop he ought
to run her.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>&#8220;I reckon
I&#8217;ll run her without any help from you, Norton!&#8221; snapped the
sheriff.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, sure!&#8221; agreed the latter, his gaze level as his eyes met
the sheriff&#8217;s, his voice even and sarcastic. &#8220;But I&#8217;m
tellin&#8217; you that this man&#8217;s my friend an&#8217; if there&#8217;s any
more of them compliments goin&#8217; to be handed around I&#8217;m warnin&#8217;
you that you want to hand them out soft an&#8217; gentle like. That&#8217;s all.
I reckon we c&#8217;n now proceed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sheriff&#8217;s face bloated poisonously. He flashed a malignant glance
at Hollis. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he snapped, &#8220;what&#8217;s the
charge?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have already told you,&#8221; returned Hollis. &#8220;It is stealing
cattle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How stealin&#8217; them?&#8221; demanded the Sheriff truculenty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Changing the brand,&#8221; Hollis informed him. He related how Ace and
Weary had come upon the prisoner while the latter was engaged in changing his
brand to the Circle Cross.</p>

<p>&#8220;They see him brandin&#8217;?&#8221; questioned the sheriff when Hollis
had concluded.</p>

<p>Hollis told him that the two men had come upon Greasy after the brand had
been applied, but that the cattle bore the Circle Bar ear-mark, and that Greasy
had built a fire and that branding irons had been found in his
possession&#8211;which <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_253'></a>253</span> which he had tried to hide when discovered by the
Circle Bar men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then your men didn&#8217;t really see him doin&#8217; the
brandin&#8217;?&#8221; questioned Watkins.</p>

<p>Hollis was forced to admit that they had not. Watkins smiled
sarcastically.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon you&#8217;re runnin&#8217; a little bit wild,&#8221; he
remarked. &#8220;Some of your stock has been rebranded an&#8217; you&#8217;re
chargin&#8217; a certain man with doin&#8217; it&#8211;only you didn&#8217;t see
him doin&#8217; it.&#8221; He turned to Greasy. &#8220;What you got to say about
this, Greasy?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>Greasy grinned blandly at Hollis. &#8220;This guy&#8217;s talkin&#8217;
through his hat,&#8221; he sneered. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t allowin&#8217; that I
branded any of his cattle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Watkins smiled. &#8220;There don&#8217;t seem to be nothin&#8217; to this
case a-tall&#8211;not a-tall. There ain&#8217;t nobody goin&#8217; to be took
into custody by me for stealin&#8217; cattle unless they&#8217;re ketched with
the goods&#8211;an&#8217; that ain&#8217;t been proved so far.&#8221; He turned
to Hollis. &#8220;You got anything more to say about it?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only this,&#8221; returned Hollis slowly and evenly, &#8220;I have
brought this man here. I charge him with stealing my cattle. To use your
term&#8211;he was caught &#8216;with the goods.&#8217; He is guilty. If you take him
into custody and bring him to trial I shall have two witnesses there to <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254'></a>254</span> prove what I have
already told you. If you do not take him into custody, it is perfectly plain
that you are deliberately shielding him&#8211;that you are making a joke of the
law.&#8221;</p>

<p>Watkins&#8217;s face reddened angrily. &#8220;Mebbe I&#8217;m makin&#8217; a
joke of it&#8213;&#8221; he began.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course we can&#8217;t force you to arrest this man,&#8221; resumed
Hollis, interrupting Watkins. &#8220;Unfortunately the government has not yet
awakened to the fact that such men as you are a public menace and danger. I did
not expect you to arrest him&#8211;I tell you that frankly. I merely brought him
here to see whether it were true that you were leagued with Dunlavey against the
other ranchers in the country. You are, of course. Therefore, as we cannot
secure justice by appealing to you we will be forced to adopt other
means.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sheriff&#8217;s right hand dropped to his gun-holster. He sneered, his
lips writhing. &#8220;Mebbe you mean&#8213;&#8221; he began.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t lettin&#8217; this here situation get beyond my
control,&#8221; came Norton&#8217;s voice, cold and even, as his six-shooter
came out and was shoved menacingly forward. &#8220;Whatever he means, Watkins,
he&#8217;s my friend an&#8217; you ain&#8217;t runnin&#8217; in no cold lead
proposition on him.&#8221; He smiled mirthlessly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255'></a>255</span>Watkins&#8217;s
face paled; his right hand fell away from the pistol holster. There was a sound
at the door; it swung suddenly open and Dunlavey&#8217;s gigantic frame loomed
massively in the opening.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m looking for Greasy!&#8221; he announced in a soft, silky
voice, looking around at the four men with a comprehending, appreciative smile.
&#8220;I was expecting to find him here,&#8221; he added as his gaze sought out
the prisoner, &#8220;after I heard that he&#8217;d been nabbed by the Circle Bar
men.&#8221;</p>

<p>Norton smiled coldly. &#8220;He&#8217;s here, Bill,&#8221; he said evenly.
&#8220;He&#8217;s stayin&#8217; here till Mr. Hollis says it&#8217;s time for
him to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not move the weapon in his hand, but a certain glint in his eyes told
Dunlavey that the pistol was not in his hand for mere show. The latter smiled
knowingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not interfering with the law,&#8221; he said mockingly.
&#8220;And I certainly ain&#8217;t bucking your game, Norton.&#8221; He turned
to Watkins, speaking with broad insinuation: &#8220;Of course you are putting a
charge against Greasy, Watkins?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>They all caught the sheriff&#8217;s flush; all saw the guilty embarrassment in his
eyes as he answered that he had not. Dunlavey turned to Hollis with a bland
smile.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256'></a>256</span>&#8220;Have you
any objection to allowing Greasy to go now, Mr. Hollis?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis&#8217;s smile was no less bland as his gaze met Dunlavey&#8217;s.
&#8220;Not the slightest objection, Mr. Dunlavey,&#8221; he returned. &#8220;I
congratulate you upon the manner in which you have trained your servants!&#8221;
He ignored Dunlavey and smiled at Norton. &#8220;Mr. Norton,&#8221; he said with
polite mockery, &#8220;I feel certain that you agree with me that we have no
wish to contaminate this temple of justice with our presence.&#8221;</p>

<p>He bowed with mock politeness as he strode to the door and stepped down into
the street. Norton followed him, grinning, though he did not sheath his weapon
until he also was in the street.</p>

<p>As they strode away from the door they turned to see Dunlavey looking out
after them, his face wreathed in a broad smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is plenty of law in Union County, Mr. Hollis,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;if you know how to handle it!&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257'></a>257</span><a id='link_20'></a>CHAPTER XX<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE &#8220;KICKER&#8217;S&#8221; CANDIDATE</span></h2>

<p>The next issue of the <i>Kicker</i> contained many things of interest to its
readers. Now that the drought had been broken, Union County could proceed with
its business of raising cattle without fear of any future lack of water, with
plenty of grass, and no losses except those from the usual causes. Dry Bottom
merchants&#8211;depending upon the cattlemen for their trade&#8211;breathed
easier and predicted a good year in spite of the drought. Their worries over,
they had plenty of time&#8211;and inclination&#8211;to discuss the
<i>Kicker</i>.</p>

<p>More advertisements were appearing in the paper. Dry Bottom merchants were
beginning to realize that it deserved their support, and with few exceptions
they openly began to voice their opinions that the editor would &#8220;make
good.&#8221;&#8217; The advertisements began to take on a livelier tone and the
Lazette <i>Eagle</i> grew more sarcastic.</p>

<p>When the <i>Kicker</i> appeared following the incident <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_258'></a>258</span> in the sheriff&#8217;s office, there
was a detailed account of Dunlavey&#8217;s now famous &#8220;ten day
edict,&#8221; together with some uncomplimentary comments upon the
latter&#8217;s action. This was signed by Hollis. He called attention to
Dunlavey&#8217;s selfishness, to the preparations that had been made by him to
shoot down all the foreign cattle on the Rabbit-Ear. He made no reference to his
part in the affair&#8211;to his decision to allow the small ranchers to water
their cattle in the river at the imminent risk of losing his own. But though he
did not mention this, the small owners and his friends took care that the matter
received full publicity, with the result that Hollis was kept busy assuring his
admirers that the incident had been much magnified&#8211;especially his part of
it. Then his friends applauded his modesty.</p>

<p>In the same issue of the paper was also related the story of Greasy&#8217;s
capture by the Circle Bar men. But in telling this story Hollis was not so
modest, for he spoke frankly of his part in it&#8211;how he had refused to allow
his men to hang the thief, telling his readers that though Greasy deserved
hanging, he did not purpose to violate the law while advocating it. Following
the story of the capture was a detailed report of the incident in the
sheriff&#8217;s office and a scathing commentary <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_259'></a>259</span> upon the subservience of the latter
official to Dunlavey&#8217;s will. The article was entitled: &#8220;Handling the
Law,&#8221; and Dunlavey&#8217;s exact words when he stood in the door of the
sheriff&#8217;s office as Hollis and Norton departed were repeated.</p>

<p>Below this, under the rubric, &#8220;Union County Needs a New Sheriff,&#8221;
appeared an article that created a sensation. This dwelt upon the necessity of
the county having a sheriff who would not permit his office to be prostituted by
any man or influence. The <i>Kicker</i> named a man who would not be bribed or
cowed and declared that his name would appear on the ballot at the next
election&#8211;to be held on the first Monday in November. At the end of the
article he printed the man&#8217;s name&#8211;Ben Allen!</p>

<p>He had made this announcement without authority, and therefore he was not
surprised, soon after the appearance of the issue containing the article, to see
Allen&#8217;s tall figure darken the door of the <i>Kicker</i> office while he
sat at his desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Durn your hide!&#8221; cried the latter as he stood in the doorway;
&#8220;you&#8217;re the biggest disturber in seven states!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; smiled Hollis, motioning Allen to a chair.
&#8220;Still, you don&#8217;t need to thank me. You see, I have decided to clean
up this county <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260'></a>260</span> and
I need some help. I supposed you were interested. Of course you may refuse if
you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Refuse!&#8221; Allen&#8217;s eyes flashed as he took Hollis&#8217;s
hand and wrung it heartily. &#8220;My boy,&#8221; he declared earnestly,
&#8220;you couldn&#8217;t have done anything to suit me better. I&#8217;m just
yearning to take a big hand in this game!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Interesting, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; smiled Hollis.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some,&#8221; returned Allen. He grasped Hollis&#8217;s hand and wrung
it heartily. &#8220;You&#8217;re a winner and I&#8217;m mighty glad to be able
to work with you.&#8221; He spoke seriously. &#8220;Do you think there&#8217;s a
chance for us to beat Dunlavey?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis laughed. &#8220;I flatter myself that a certain editor in this town
stands rather well with the people of this county since a certain thing
happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You sure do!&#8221; grinned Allen. &#8220;Lordy! how this county has
needed a man like you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis smiled. &#8220;Then you won&#8217;t object to being the
<i>Kicker&#8217;s</i> candidate?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Object!&#8221; returned Allen with mock seriousness. &#8220;Say, young
man, if you don&#8217;t keep my name at the head of your editorial column from
now till the first Monday in November I&#8217;ll come down here and manhandle
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>And so it was arranged. Dry Bottom gasped <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_261'></a>261</span> in public but rejoiced in secret. Many of the
town&#8217;s merchants personally congratulated Hollis.</p>

<p>But for two days following the appearance of the issue of the <i>Kicker</i>
containing these sensations, Hollis stayed away from Dry Bottom. Now that he had
launched Allen&#8217;s campaign and placed the other matters before his readers,
he began to devote some attention to the problem of arranging for Ed
Hazelton&#8217;s visit to the great Chicago surgeon. Both Nellie and Ed had been
disappointed because of his continued absence, and when, on an afternoon a few
days after his activity in Dry Bottom, he rode up to the Hazelton cabin his
welcome was a cordial one.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems like a year since I&#8217;ve seen you!&#8221; declared
Hazelton as he came down from the porch to lead Hollis&#8217;s pony into the
shade at the rear of the cabin.</p>

<p>While he was gone with the pony Hollis stood looking up at Nellie, who had
remained seated in her chair on the porch and who was now regarding him with
eyes in which shone unconcealed pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;It hasn&#8217;t really been so long, you know,&#8221; said Hollis,
smiling at her. &#8220;But then, I have been so busy that I may not have noticed
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course she could not tell him how many <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_262'></a>262</span> times she had sat on the porch during Ed&#8217;s
absences watching the Coyote trail. But she blushed and made room for him on the
porch. Ed appeared presently and joined them there. The young man was not able
to conceal his joy over the prospect of his ultimate recovery from the peculiar
malady that afflicted him, and gratitude mingled with it as he looked at his
benefactor. He had not recovered from an attack the day before.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got it all arranged,&#8221; he told Hollis with a wan
smile. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to Chicago just as soon as I can get things
fixed.&#8221; He reddened with embarrassment as he continued:
&#8220;There&#8217;s some things that I&#8217;d like to talk to you about before
I make up my mind when to start,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I&#8217;ve been worrying
about what to do with my stock while I&#8217;m gone. I wouldn&#8217;t want it to
stray or be run off by Dunlavey&#8217;s gang.&#8221; The appeal in his eyes did
not escape Hollis&#8217;s keen observation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have thought of that too,&#8221; smiled the latter. &#8220;In fact,
I have talked it over with Norton. He tells me that he won&#8217;t have any
trouble in caring for your stock while you are away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks.&#8221; Hazelton did not trust himself to say more at that
moment. He knew how great would be the task of caring for his stock <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263'></a>263</span> during his absence, and
had not Hollis come to his aid with this offer he would have had to give up the
proposed trip. He sat silent until his composure returned, and then he looked up
at Hollis gratefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;That will make things much easier for Nellie,&#8221; he said. And
then, remembering that Hollis knew nothing of his intention to ask him for
permission to allow Nellie to remain at the Circle Bar during his absence, he
fell silent again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Easier?&#8221; inquired Hollis, puzzled. He had supposed that Nellie
would accompany her brother to Chicago. He did not look at either of the two for
a time. He had been anticipating a period of lonesomeness and this unexpected
news came like a bright shaft of light into the darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you can&#8217;t allow her to stay at the cabin alone!&#8221; he
said when Ed did not answer. And then the thought struck him that this peculiar
silence on Ed&#8217;s part could mean only one thing&#8211;that he and Nellie
had decided that she was not to accompany him, and that the problem that was now
confronting them&#8211;since he had told them that his men would care for the
cattle&#8211;was the girl&#8217;s welfare. He appreciated the situation and
smiled wisely into the yawning <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_264'></a>264</span> distance. But a deep sympathy made the smile
grim.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have sometimes wondered how it were possible for a woman to live in
this country without having close at hand one of her sex with whom to
gossip,&#8221; he remarked, looking at Ed and deliberately closing an eye at
him. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t bother a man so much&#8211;this being alone. If he
is a drinking man there are the saloons; if a poet he may write wise saws
concerning the inconstancy of women; he may punch cows, another man&#8217;s
head&#8211;or run a newspaper. In any case his mind is occupied.</p>

<p>&#8220;But a woman! Of course it is different with a woman. A woman must
talk&#8211;she simply can&#8217;t help it. There&#8217;s Mrs. Norton. Only this
morning I chanced to hear her remark to her lord and master that if he did not
soon provide her with a companion with whom she might discuss the things which
are dear to the feminine heart, he might as well make up his mind to requisition
the mourners. All of which suggests the thought that perhaps it would not be a
bad idea for Miss Hazelton to bundle up her things and advance on the Circle
Bar. Thus two ends will be served&#8211;Mrs. Norton will secure her companion
and Norton will find peace.&#8221; He turned to Nellie. &#8220;Of course if you
are afraid that the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_265'></a>265</span> cabin will stray during your absence I could manage
to ride the Coyote trail each morning and evening&#8211;or you could ride over
yourself occasionally.&#8221;</p>

<p>He could tell by the light in her eyes that she was pleased over the
suggestion. He was sure of it when she smiled at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you really think that Mrs. Norton would like some one to talk
to&#8213;&#8221; she began, and then hesitated, her eyes suddenly widening as
she saw an odd light in his. &#8220;Oh!&#8221; she said, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t
true about Mrs. Norton wanting to talk. You have guessed that I&#8211;that
Ed&#8211;wanted me to go&#8213;&#8221; But confusion descended upon her and she
flushed crimson with embarrassment.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you think it isn&#8217;t true, why don&#8217;t you ride over to the
Circle Bar and inquire?&#8221; he smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I may,&#8221; she replied, looking at him in mock
defiance.</p>

<p>As a precaution against the carrying out of this threat, Hollis that night
acquainted Mrs. Norton with the facts in the case, even going so far as to
inform the lady brazenly that he had deliberately lied about her. But when she
had been fully informed, she told Hollis that she did not blame him very much,
and that should Nellie carry out her threat to come to her upon an errand having
as its object a question of his veracity, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_266'></a>266</span> she would assure the young lady that he had spoken
the plain truth. Would that be sufficient?</p>

<p>Hollis told her that it would, and the following morning on his way to Dry
Bottom, he took the Coyote trail and stopped off at the Hazelton cabin, where he
informed Ed that he had decided to send Weary with him on his trip to
Chicago.</p>

<p>Nellie spoke a few words to him while he lingered beside the porch, but her
threat of the night before was not repeated and Hollis rightly guessed that it
would never be carried out.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267'></a>267</span><a id='link_21'></a>CHAPTER XXI<br /><span class='h2fs'>DUNLAVEY PLAYS A CARD</span></h2>

<p>During the week following Ed Hazelton&#8217;s departure for Chicago Hollis
did not see much of Nellie. In the few days preceding his departure she had not
allowed her brother to see how his refusal to allow her to accompany him had
hurt her, but once he had boarded the east-bound express at Dry Bottom, she had
yielded to the emotions that she had so far succeeded in concealing. Hollis had
ridden in to town with them, and not until Nellie and he had seen Ed and Weary
safely on the train&#8211;indeed, not until the train was well under way and the
two figures on the back platform could no longer be discerned&#8211;did Nellie
break down. Then Hollis turned to her with a smile to see the sudden tears well
up into her eyes. He had not attempted to console her, feeling the awkwardness
of the situation.</p>

<p>He was much relieved when she refused his offer to make the return trip with
her, for he was certain that a few hours alone in which to <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_268'></a>268</span> meditate over her loss would enable her
to regain her composure. But before leaving her he secured her promise not to
stop at the cabin, but to go on to the Circle Bar. On her arrival at the ranch
she was to tell Norton to send one of the men to the cabin after the few
personal effects that she had decided to transfer. But once out of
Hollis&#8217;s sight Nellie forgot her promise through fear over the safety of
her things. She took the Coyote trail, riding slowly through the clear sunshine
of the morning.</p>

<p>After taking leave of Nellie Hollis rode slowly down the street to the
<i>Kicker</i> office. He looked in through the window and seeing that Potter had
not yet arrived, continued down to the court house. He talked for a few minutes
with Judge Graney. Nothing new had developed. Ben Allen had gone to visit
several small ranchers the day before and had not returned.</p>

<p>Hollis returned to the <i>Kicker</i> office. At noon Potter had arrived,
bearing the news that he had seen Nellie Hazelton on the Coyote trail, within a
few miles of the Circle Bar. She had stopped at her cabin and there were several
bundles strapped to the cantle of her saddle.</p>

<p>That night Hollis did not see her at all. He did not inquire for her, but
surmised that she was in her room. The next morning soon after <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269'></a>269</span> he had awakened and
while he still debated the question of arising, he heard her singing in the
kitchen. He smiled, thinking how quickly she had adapted herself to her new
surroundings.</p>

<p>At breakfast he looked closely at her several times, searching for evidence
of her grief of yesterday. There was none. Therefore he was not surprised when,
after breakfast, she told him that she intended riding with him as far as the
cabin for the purpose of bringing the remainder of her effects. He gravely
reminded her that she had broken her promise of yesterday, and that as a
punishment he contemplated refusing her request. But when, an hour later, he
urged his pony down the river trail she was riding beside him.</p>

<p>But she did not ride again that week. She did not tell Hollis the reason;
that returning that evening she had reached the Razor-Back and was riding along
its crest when she happened to glance across the Rabbit-Ear toward the Circle
Cross. On the opposite side of the river she had seen two men, sitting quietly
in their saddles, watching her. They were Dunlavey and Yuma. She did not know
what their presence there meant, but the sight was disquieting and she feared to
return to the cabin for the few things that were still here.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270'></a>270</span>But as the days
went her fears were dispersed. Time and the lure of her old home had revived her
courage, and on a day about a week following her previous trip, she herself
saddled and bridled her pony and set out over the Coyote trail toward her
cabin.</p>

<p>She had not told Hollis of her intention to ride there, fearing that the
knowledge of what she had seen on the day of the other ride would be revealed in
her eyes. It was a good hour after noon when she stole out of the house to her
pony, mounted, and rode away toward the river.</p>

<p>For many days she had been wondering at Dunlavey&#8217;s continued inaction.
He had been known as an energetic enemy, and though at their last meeting in Dry
Bottom he had threatened her and her brother, he had so far made no hostile
move. Uusually he would go a considerable distance out of his way to speak to
her. Perhaps, she thought, at their last meeting she had shown him that he was
wasting his time. Yet she could not forget that day when she had seen Yuma and
Dunlavey on the Circle Cross side of the Rabbit-Ear. The sight somehow had been
significant and forbidding.</p>

<p>But when she reached her cabin she had forgotten Dunlavey and Yuma; her
thoughts dwelt upon more pleasant people. Had she <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_271'></a>271</span> done right in allowing Hollis to see
that she was interested in him? Would he think less of her for revealing this
interest? She could not answer these questions, but she could answer
another&#8211;one that brought the blushes to her cheeks. Why had Hollis shown
an interest in her? She had known this answer for a long time&#8211;when she had
read Ace&#8217;s poem to him while sitting on the porch beside him, to be
perfectly accurate. She had pretended then to take offense when he had assured
her that Ace had succeeded in getting much truth into his lines, especially into
the first couplet, which ran:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>&#8220;Woman&#8211;she don&#8217;t need no tutor,<br /> Be she school
ma&#8217;am or biscuit shooter.&#8221;</p> </div><!-- poetry -->

<p>The language had not been graceful, nor the diction, yet she knew that Ace
had struck the mark fairly, for woman indeed needed no tutor to teach her to
understand man&#8211;woman had always understood him.</p>

<p>She dismounted from her pony at the edge of the porch, hitching the animal to
one of the slender porch columns. Then she went into the house to gather up the
few things that still remained there.</p>

<p>But for a long time after entering the cabin <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_272'></a>272</span> she sat on a chair in the kitchen, sobbing softly,
for now that Ed had gone she felt the desolation of the country more than ever.
Presently she rose and with a start looked out of the door. The dusk had fallen;
darkness was stealing into the valley around the cabin!</p>

<p>Flitting here and there, she hurriedly began packing things which she took
from shelves and racks. It was an engrossing task and she was much interested in
it, so much so that she did not hear a slight sound at the door that led out to
the front porch. But when she saw a shadow darken the doorway of the room in
which she was working she stood suddenly erect and with rapidly beating heart
stole softly forward and peered around the door-jamb. Of course it could be no
one but Hollis. He had taken the Coyote trail to-night. He would be surprised to
see her.</p>

<p>But it was she who was surprised. Yuma stood near the table in the center of
the kitchen, looking straight at her, his insolent, evil face drawn into a
foreboding smile.</p>

<p>After the first gasp of horror and surprise a righteous anger stiffened
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221; she demanded.</p>

<p>Yuma&#8217;s evil smile grew. She had seen him often, usually at a distance,
for she had abhorred <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_273'></a>273</span> him, with his olive skin, his thin, cruel lips and
small glittering eyes. He had always seemed like an animal to her, though she
could not have told why. She thought it must be something in his attitude, in
the stoop which was almost a crouch, in the stealthy, cat-like manner in which
he walked. She had spoken to Ed about him more than once, conveying to him her
abhorrence of the man, and he had told her that he felt the same about him. She
shuddered now, thinking of what her brother had told her of the man&#8217;s
cruelty. Dunlavey had often boasted that Yuma was the most venomous and
bloodthirsty of his crew of cut-throats.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221; she repeated, her anger growing.</p>

<p>Yuma laughed softly. &#8220;I saw you ridin&#8217; the Razor Back the other
day,&#8221; he said, showing his teeth as the words came&#8211;even, smooth,
burdened with a subtle mockery. &#8220;I saw you again thees afternoon&#8211;but
you not see me like the other day&#8211;I watch you thees long.&#8221; He held
up three fingers to denote that he had watched her three hours. She shuddered,
suddenly realizing the significance of his attitude that day she had seen him
from the Razor Back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ed gone,&#8221; he continued, watching her narrowly; &#8220;nobody
here; I come. I like <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_274'></a>274</span> you&#8211;much.&#8221; He grinned, his eyes
brightening. &#8220;I reckon you know&#8211;you girl that
understan&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew a slow deep breath. Curiously enough, next to the horror and doubt
that she felt over Yuma&#8217;s presence at the cabin was a wonder for the
idioms of cowboy speech that were interjected with his own. He had caught them
from association, she supposed. She made a pretense of boldness, though she felt
more like screaming.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave this cabin!&#8221; she commanded sharply.</p>

<p>Yuma did not change his position. &#8220;Leave heem?&#8221; he laughed.
&#8220;I theenk not. Dunlavey says me come here&#8211;make um love me&#8211;same
as tenderfoot noospaper man!&#8221; He laughed again, exultantly.
&#8220;Dunlavey say you spark tenderfoot&#8211;you spark me!&#8221;</p>

<p>She trembled, realizing that a crisis was at hand and that she must meet it
boldly. She thought of the ivory-handled weapon in the holster at her hip and
involuntarily her right hand dropped to its butt. She had learned to shoot, but
she had never yet shot at a man and she drew her hand away from the butt of the
weapon with a shudder. Yuma had been watching her closely, his evil little eyes
glittering, and when he saw her hand drop away he laughed derisively.</p>

<p>&#8220;You no shoot heem!&#8221; he said. &#8220;You &#8217;fraid. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275'></a>275</span> Dunlavey say he reckon
you no shoot&#8211;say you make love to um right away!&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled significantly and took a step toward her. She made an involuntary
step backward and her right hand again sought the butt of the revolver, the left
closing on the edge of the door that opened into her room. Terror had given her
courage and as Yuma continued to advance with a soft, cautious, cat-like sliding
movement, she drew the revolver and presented it, though her hand wavered a
little.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you take another step toward me, Yuma, I will kill you!&#8221; she
declared.</p>

<p>She saw his little eyes glitter with decision, saw him measure the distance
between them, saw him crouch for a spring.</p>

<p>She fired, aiming at the lower edge of the scarf that sagged at his throat.
The smoke from the pistol blinded her; she heard his laugh, heard the rush of
his feet as he hurled himself forward. Terror stricken over her failure to hit
him, she dropped the pistol and whirled, grasping the edge of the door and
slamming it shut in his face. She felt his weight against it, but he had been
taken by surprise by the movement; there was the strength of desperation in her
body and she held the door closed against him while she shoved the fastenings
into place.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276'></a>276</span>Then, suddenly
overcome, she leaned weakly against the jamb, her heart thumping hard, her
nerves tingling.</p>

<p>For a long time she did not move, and there came no sound from the other side
of the door to tell her of Yuma&#8217;s movements. There was a wild hope in her
heart that he had gone, but presently, becoming a little calmer, she pressed her
ear against the door. There was no doubt of Yuma&#8217;s presence; she could
hear him stepping softly about the room. Had there been a window in the room in
which she had imprisoned herself she might have escaped, but unfortunately there
was not.</p>

<p>She fell to thinking of the revolver she had dropped when Yuma had sprung
upon her. It must have dropped very close to the door. Had Yuma picked it up?
There was a chance that he had not. If the weapon were still there and she could
open the door and secure it and close the door again, she would be in a position
to defend herself. She could not defend herself without it. If Yuma should burst
the door open she would be at his mercy. She must get the revolver.</p>

<p>Convinced of this she stood for some little time at the door, her ear pressed
against it, listening for any sound that might tell her of the whereabouts <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277'></a>277</span> of Yuma in the cabin.
She heard nothing. Perhaps he had gone? But she listened a while longer,
determined to be certain before loosening the fastenings of the door.
Silence&#8211;a premonitory silence&#8211;filled the room beyond the door. She
could hear nothing except her own rapid breathing. Presently she heard a horse
whinny. Was Yuma at the horses? It seemed incredible that any man should visit
the cabin purposely to attack her. Perhaps Yuma had only intended to frighten
her; he had said that Dunlavey had told him to follow her, but she believed that
Dunlavey, in spite of his reputation for lawlessness and trickery, was not so
unmanly as to incite the half-breed to attack her. He may have told him to steal
the horses&#8211;she could believe that of him!</p>

<p>But for a long time, in spite of the quieting influence of these thoughts,
she kept her ear pressed against the door. Then, moved by a sudden
impulse&#8211;an accession of courage inspired by the continued
silence&#8211;she cautiously loosened the fastenings and swung the door slowly
open.</p>

<p>Her revolver lay close and with a swift movement she reached for it. As her
fingers grasped its butt she heard a slight sound and Yuma was upon her from
behind, pinning her arms to her <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_278'></a>278</span> sides. She felt his breath on her neck, heard his
laugh, exultant and derisive, mocking her. His right hand, gripping hers
tightly, was slipping slowly down toward the hand that held the revolver. She
struggled desperately, squirming and twisting in his grasp, silently matching
her strength against his. Finding this hopeless and feeling his hand gradually
slipping toward the revolver, she suddenly raised her hand toward her face,
bringing Yuma&#8217;s hand, still on her arm, with it. Then she dropped her head
to his arm near the wrist, and sank her teeth savagely into the flesh.</p>

<p>Yuma howled in anguish, loosening his hold momentarily. In an instant she had
wrenched herself free and had bounded to the center of the room, placing the
kitchen table between herself and her assailant.</p>

<p>But he was after her with a bound, his little eyes gleaming with a venomous
expression, his face contorted with passion. She raised the revolver and fired.
For a breathless instant she thought that she had hit him, for he sank almost to
the floor. But she saw that it was only a trick for he was up again on the
instant, a mocking smile on his face and closer than ever. She fired again, and
when she saw him sink to the floor she pulled the trigger a second time. He had
been <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279'></a>279</span> very close to
the table when she fired the last time and before she could press the trigger
again he had lurched forward under it, raising it on his shoulders and sending
it crashing down behind him as he confronted her, his evil face close to hers,
his hands again gripping her arms.</p>

<p>She fought him silently, and together they reeled around the cabin. She bit
him again, and then in an outburst of savage fury he brutally twisted the arm in
which she still held the revolver, sending the weapon crashing to the floor.
While twisting her arm he had been compelled to loosen his grasp of the other
slightly, and she again wrenched herself free and darted toward the door leading
to the porch. But he bounded forward, intercepting her, and with a last,
despairing effort she raised both hands to his face and clawed furiously at his
eyes.</p>

<p>She heard a savage curse from him, saw the lust of murder in his little,
glittering eyes, felt his sinewy fingers at her throat. Then objects within the
cabin swam in a dizzy, blurring circle before her. She heard a
crash&#8211;seeming to come from a great distance; heard Yuma curse again. And
then, borne resistlessly forward by the weight of his body, she tumbled to the
floor in an inert heap.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280'></a>280</span><a id='link_22'></a>CHAPTER XXII<br /><span class='h2fs'>PROOF OF GRATITUDE</span></h2>

<p>Shortly after noon on the same day Hollis, finding work irksome, closed his
desk with a bang, told Potter that he was going home, mounted his pony, and
loped the animal out the Dry Bottom trail. He remembered hearing Norton tell one
of the men that morning that he suspected that several of Ed Hazelton&#8217;s
cattle were still in the vicinity of the basin near the Hazelton cabin, and he
determined to ride around that way and try to turn them back toward the Circle
Bar. It would be recreation for him after a hot morning in the office.</p>

<p>He also remembered another thing that had occurred that morning at the ranch
house. Mrs. Norton had assured him&#8211;with a sly, eloquent glance at
him&#8211;that he might do worse than to make arrangements to keep Nellie
Hazelton at the Circle Bar indefinitely. At the risk of being considered obtuse
Hollis had ignored the hint, broad though it had been. But Mrs. Norton&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281'></a>281</span> words had shown
him that Nellie stood high in her estimation and he felt a queer, unaccountable
elation.</p>

<p>After striking the Dry Bottom trail he took a circuitous route and some time
later came out upon a high ridge overlooking a basin. There were some cattle
down there and he made a mental note of the locality so that he would be able to
tell Norton where to have the men look for the cattle. Then he rode along the
ridge until he could no longer see the basin. He spent most of the afternoon
exploring the surrounding country, and then when the dusk began to fall he
retraced his steps to the ridge upon which he had ridden earlier in the
afternoon. Something familiar in the shape of the hills near him struck him and
he halted his pony and smiled. These were the hills that he had seen many times
from the Hazelton porch. He faced around, certain that if the hills could be
seen from the porch he would be able to discern the porch from some point on the
ridge, for he was satisfied that he must be nearly in line with it. He rode back
and forth a few moments, and then, coming out on a bald spot on the ridge, he
saw the cabin.</p>

<p>It was about a mile away, snuggled comfortably down in a little basin, with
some trees and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282'></a>282</span>
shrubbery flanking it on both sides. He smiled as he looked at it, and then
suddenly his face clouded, for he saw two ponies hitched to the porch. His
forehead wrinkled perplexedly over this. He was certain that Nellie rode the
same animal each time, because she would not trust any of the others that were
now with the remuda. One of the horses belonged to her of course, for he could
see the gay ribbon with which she was accustomed to decorate her animal&#8217;s
bridle. But to whom did the other horse belong? He gazed steadily toward the
cabin, searching for signs of life on the porch. But though he could see
clearly&#8211;even into the shadows from a rambling rose bush that clung to the
eaves of the roof&#8211;no human figure appeared on the porch.</p>

<p>Certainly Nellie must have a visitor. But who? He was not aware that the
Hazeltons had made friends with anyone in the neighborhood besides himself and
the Nortons. He smiled. Probably some cowboy from the Circle Bar had been in the
vicinity looking for Hazelton&#8217;s cattle, had met Nellie, and had stopped at
the cabin. He remembered to have heard Norton say that he was sending a man in
that direction some time that day.</p>

<p>That must be the explanation. But while he sat, debating the propriety of
riding down to the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283'></a>283</span>
cabin to satisfy his curiosity, the sound of a pistol shot floated to his ears
on the slight breeze that was blowing toward him.</p>

<p>He sat erect, his face paling. Then he smiled again. He had been in the West
long enough to become acquainted with the cowboy nature and he surmised that
Nellie&#8217;s visitor was very likely exhibiting his skill with the revolver.
But he turned his pony and urged it down the sloping side of the ridge, riding
slowly in the direction of the cabin.</p>

<p>After striking the bottom of the slope he rode cut upon a broad level that
stretched away for half a mile. He made better time here and had almost covered
half the width of the plain when two more reports reached his ears. He was close
enough now to hear them distinctly and it seemed to him that they sounded
muffled. He halted the pony and sat stiffly in the saddle, his gaze on the
cabin. Then he saw a thin stream of blue-white smoke issue from the doorway and
curl lazily upward.</p>

<p>A grave doubt assailed him. No cowboy would be likely to exhibit his skill
with a weapon in the cabin! Nellie&#8217;s visitor must be an unwelcome one!</p>

<p>The pony felt the sudden spurs and raced like a whirlwind over the remaining
stretch of plain. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284'></a>284</span>
Hollis had become suddenly imbued with a suspicion that brought an ashen pallor
to his face and an awful rage into his heart. He slid his pony down one side of
a steep arroyo, sent it scrambling up the other side, jumped it over some rocks
that littered the rise, spurred savagely through a little basin, and reaching
the edge of the porch, dismounted and bounded to the door.</p>

<p>He saw two figures&#8211;Nellie Hazelton and a man. He saw the man&#8217;s
fingers gripping the girl&#8217;s throat and the lust of murder surged over and
blinded him. In the dusk that had fallen he could only dimly see the man&#8217;s
head and he swung his right fist at it, putting every ounce of his strength into
the blow. He felt the fist strike, realized that it had glanced, and tried to
recover for a second blow.</p>

<p>But the terrific swing had carried him off his balance. He whirled clear
around, slipped, and came down to the floor flat on his face. He was up in an
instant, however, his brain afire with rage, his muscles tingling with
eagerness. He did not think of the gun at his hip, for the lust of murder was in
his soul and he wanted only to hit the man&#8211;to seize him and tear him
apart&#8211;to crush and smash the vile hands that he had seen at the
girl&#8217;s throat.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285'></a>285</span>Five feet from
him, facing him, on his hands and knees and scrambling to rise, was the man. He
recognized Yuma, and even as he bounded forward the latter gained his feet and
tugged at his gun-holster. The weapon had not yet cleared the holster when
Hollis was upon him. He struck again with his right fist and missed, crashing
against Yuma in his eagerness and carrying him down to the floor with a force
that shook the cabin. As they fell Hollis felt a sharp, agonizing pain in his
left wrist, from which the splints had been only recently removed, and the hand
hung limp at his side, entirely useless.</p>

<p>For an instant after the fall Yuma lay still, breathing heavily. Then he made
a sudden movement with his right arm and Hollis caught a glint of metal. He
threw himself at the arm, catching it with his right hand just above the wrist
and jamming it tight to the floor. Yuma tried to squirm free, failed, and with a
curse drove his left fist into the side of Hollis&#8217;s face. Again he tried
to squirm free and during the struggle that followed the hand holding the pistol
was raised from the floor. Hollis saw it and wrenched desperately at the arm,
twisting it and dragging it furiously downward to the floor. Yuma shrieked with
rage and pain as the force of <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_286'></a>286</span> the impact cracked his knuckles and sent the weapon
clattering ten feet away.</p>

<p>For an instant both men lay silent, panting from their exertions. Then Yuma
succeeded in getting one leg over Hollis&#8217;s body and one arm around his
neck. With a quick motion&#8211;successful because of Hollis&#8217;s injured
wrist&#8211;he turned the latter over on his back. His eyes alight with an
exultant, malevolent fire, he gripped Hollis&#8217;s throat with one hand and
drove at his face with the other. A quick movement of the head served to defeat
Yuma&#8217;s aim and his fist thumped heavily against the floor, bringing a
grimace of pain to his face. Disregarding his injured wrist, Hollis wrenched
savagely and succeeded in rolling free of Yuma and reaching his feet. He had
moved quickly, but the lithe, cat-like half-breed was before him, bounding
toward the pistol on the floor. He was bending over it, his fingers gripping its
butt, when Hollis, throwing himself forward bodily, crashed into him and hurled
him heavily to the floor.</p>

<p>This time Yuma lay face downward, his arms outstretched, and Hollis lay
sprawled out on top of him. But Yuma had succeeded in holding to the pistol; it
was grasped in his outstretched right hand, just out of Hollis&#8217;s
reach.</p>

<p>For an instant again both men lay silent, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_287'></a>287</span> breathing rapidly. Then, yielding to the rage that
still possessed him, Hollis bounded to his feet, striking Yuma a crashing blow
in the face as he did so. While Yuma reeled he brought his booted foot down on
the hand holding the pistol, grinding it under his heel.</p>

<p>Yuma screamed with pain and rage and got to his feet, holding his injured
hand with the other. The pistol lay on the floor where Yuma had dropped it when
Hollis&#8217;s boot had come in contact with his hand. For an instant Yuma stood
gripping his hand, his face hideous with passion. Then with a snarl of rage and
hate he drew a knife from the folds of his shirt and sprang toward Hollis.</p>

<p>Hollis tensed himself for the clash, rapidly measuring the distance, and when
Yuma came close enough caught him squarely on the side of the jaw with a vicious
right swing. But in some manner when Hollis stepped aside to avoid Yuma&#8217;s
knife, his feet had become entangled with the legs of the table that Yuma had
previously overturned. As he struck he slipped, the blow at Yuma&#8217;s jaw not
having the force he intended it to have. He caught himself, slipped again and
went down, turning completely over the table top and falling face downward to
the floor. He saw Yuma throw himself forward <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_288'></a>288</span> and he tried to wriggle out of danger, but he
failed. He felt the half-breed&#8217;s weight on his body, saw the knife flash
in the dull light. He tried to roll over and grasp the knife in its descent, but
could not, his left arm, now useless, being pinned to the floor by Yuma&#8217;s
knee.</p>

<p>A revolver roared spitefully&#8211;once&#8211;twice. Yuma&#8217;s knife
hissed past Hollis&#8217;s ear and struck the floor, its point sunk deep, its
handle swaying idly back and forth. Yuma himself&#8211;inert, limp, rolled from
Hollis&#8217;s back and lay flat on his own, his eyes wide open and staring, two
huge bullet holes in his forehead. And in the open doorway of the cabin stood
Ten Spot.</p>

<p>For an instant Hollis could not realize his escape. He looked at Yuma and
then again at Ten Spot. Slowly and painfully he got to his feet, looking around
at the wreck of the room. Staggering a little, he walked to where Ten Spot
stood, gripping the latter&#8217;s hand silently, at a loss for words with which
to thank him.</p>

<p>But apparently Ten Spot did not notice the omission, for he grinned
broadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon there&#8217;s folks which would call that a right clever bit
of shootin&#8217;,&#8221; he said, &#8220;seem&#8217; a? there wasn&#8217;t time
to pull off no fancy stuff!&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289'></a>289</span><a id='link_23'></a>CHAPTER XXIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>TEN SPOT USES HIS EYES</span></h2>

<p>The crash of Ten Spot&#8217;s pistols aroused Nellie Hazelton, and she sat up
and stared stupidly about&#8211;at Hollis, who was just rising from the floor;
at Ten Spot, who still stood in the doorway; and then at Yuma&#8217;s body,
stretched out on the floor beside the overturned table. She shuddered and
covered her face with her hands. The next instant Hollis was bending over her,
helping her to her feet, leading her to the door and assuring her in a low,
earnest voice that everything was all right, and that Yuma would never trouble
her again, and that he wanted her to get on her pony and go to the Circle Bar.
She allowed herself to be led out on the porch, but once there she looked at him
with renewed spirit.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was you who came first,&#8221; she said; &#8220;I didn&#8217;t see
you, but I heard Yuma curse, felt something strike him, and then&#8211;I must
have fainted. You see, I felt it must be you&#8211;I had been expecting
you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290'></a>290</span>As she spoke she
seized his hands and pressed them tightly, her eyes eloquent with thankfulness.
&#8220;Oh, I am so glad!&#8221; she whispered. Then she saw Ten Spot standing in
the doorway and she ran over and seized his hands also, shaking them
hysterically. And Ten Spot stood, red of face, grinning bashfully at
her&#8211;like a big, awkward, embarrassed schoolboy.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve ever been thanked for
shootin&#8217; anybody!&#8221; he confided to Hollis, later. &#8220;An&#8217; it
cert&#8217;nly did feel some strange!&#8221;</p>

<p>In spite of Hollis&#8217;s remonstrances the girl insisted on returning to
the interior of the cabin, to &#8220;bundle up her things.&#8221; Feeling the
futility of further objection, Hollis finally allowed her to enter. But while
she was busy in one of the rooms he and Ten Spot carried Yuma&#8217;s body
outside, around to the rear of the cabin.</p>

<p>Then, when the girl had finally secured her &#8220;things&#8221; and they had
been securely tied to her pony, and she had started down the trail toward the
Circle Bar ranch, Hollis and Ten Spot returned to the rear of the cabin, took up
Yuma&#8217;s body, carried it to a secluded spot at some little distance from
the cabin and there buried it deep and quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to thank you again,&#8221; said Hollis as he and Ten Spot stood
on the porch when Hollis <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_291'></a>291</span> was ready to depart; &#8220;it was a great stroke
of luck that brought you here just when you were needed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ten Spot grinned. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it was just luck that brought
me,&#8221; he said; &#8220;though mebbe it was luck that took me into the
Fashion this morning. Whatever it was, I was in there, an&#8217; I heard
Dunlavey an&#8217; Yuma cookin&#8217; this here deal. I wasn&#8217;t
feelin&#8217; entirely ongrateful for the way you&#8217;d treated me after
you&#8217;d got my gun that day in the <i>Kicker</i> office an&#8217; I
wasn&#8217;t intendin&#8217; to let happen what Dunlavey wanted to happen. So I
got out of the Fashion as soon as I could an&#8217; trailed Yuma. I&#8217;ve
been after him all day, but somehow or other I lost him an&#8217; didn&#8217;t
find out where he&#8217;d gone till a little while ago&#8211;when I heard a gun
go off. Then I hit the breeze here&#8211;after Yuma. That&#8217;s all.
That&#8217;s how I come to get here so lucky.&#8221; He stuck out a hand to
Hollis. &#8220;Well, so-long,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I&#8217;m hittin&#8217; the
breeze out of the country.&#8221; He stepped forward to his pony, but hesitated
when he heard Hollis speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;re not going back to the Circle Cross&#8211;to work for
Dunlavey?&#8221; questioned the latter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, no,&#8221; grinned Ten Spot. &#8220;You see, it might not be so
pleasant now as it&#8217;s been. I <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_292'></a>292</span> reckon when Dunlavey hears this he won&#8217;t be
exactly tickled.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis contemplated him gravely. &#8220;So you&#8217;re going to leave the
country?&#8221; he said slowly, his eyes twinkling. &#8220;I take it you are not
afraid&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221; said Ten Spot coldly and sharply. Then he grinned
with feline cordiality. &#8220;I reckon I ain&#8217;t scared of anyone,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;but I ain&#8217;t likin&#8217; to go back to the Circle Cross
after puttin&#8217; Yuma out of business. I&#8217;ve done some mean things in my
time, but I ain&#8217;t dealin&#8217; double with no man, an&#8217; I
couldn&#8217;t go back to the Circle Cross an&#8217; work for Dunlavey when I
ain&#8217;t sympathizin&#8217; with him none.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m shy of good cowhands,&#8221; offered Hollis quietly.
&#8220;If forty a month would be&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>Ten Spot&#8217;s right hand was suddenly gripping Hollis&#8217;s.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve hired a man, boss!&#8221; he said, his eyes alight with
pleasure. &#8220;Ever since you clawed me that day in the <i>Kicker</i> office
I&#8217;ve had a hankerin&#8217; to work for you. I was wonder in&#8217; if
you&#8217;d ast me. There ain&#8217;t no damn&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s a bargain,&#8221; laughed Hollis, interrupting.
&#8220;You can start right now.&#8221; He pointed to the ridge upon which he had
been riding when he heard the shot that had brought him to the cabin.
&#8220;Some of Ed Hazelton&#8217;s cattle <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_293'></a>293</span> are in the basin on the other side of that
ridge,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You go over there and keep an eye on them until I
can get a chance to send some one here to help you drive them back up the river
toward the Circle Bar.&#8221; As he came to the edge of the porch to mount his
pony his gaze fell on Yuma&#8217;s horse, still hitched to one of the columns.
&#8220;What are we going to do with Yuma&#8217;s horse?&#8221; he
questioned.</p>

<p>Ten Spot grinned. He walked over to the pony, unhitched it, and with a
vicious slap on the flank sent it loping down the trail toward the river.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll be my message to Dunlavey that Yuma ain&#8217;t here any
more,&#8221; he said grimly.</p>

<p>Hollis mounted and rode a short distance, but halted and turned in the saddle
when he heard Ten Spot call to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boss,&#8221; he said with a grin, &#8220;I ain&#8217;t exactly blind,
an&#8217; mebbe you&#8217;ve got your eyes with you, too. But I saw that there
Hazelton girl lookin&#8217; at you sorta&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>He saw a smile on Hollis&#8217;s face, but the rest of his speech was drowned
in a clatter of hoofs as the &#8220;boss&#8217;s&#8221; pony tore down the
Coyote trail. Then Ten Spot smiled, mounted his pony, and rode away toward the
ridge.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294'></a>294</span><a id='link_24'></a>CHAPTER XXIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>CAMPAIGN GUNS</span></h2>

<p>Of course Yuma had been amply punished for his part in the attack on Nellie
Hazelton, but there still remained Dunlavey&#8211;who had instigated it. Hollis
was aware of the uselessness of bringing a charge against Dunlavey&#8211;he had
not forgotten his experience with Bill Watkins when he had attempted to have
Greasy brought to justice. He believed that he would not have brought such a
charge had there been any probability of the sheriff taking action. He felt that
in inciting Yuma to attack Nellie, Dunlavey had also contemplated a blow at him.
The man&#8217;s devilish ingenuity appalled him, but it also aroused a fierce
anger in his heart that, in the absence of a powerful will, would have moved him
to immediate vengeance.</p>

<p>But he contemplated no immediate action. Besides the attack on Nellie
Hazelton there was another score to settle with Dunlavey, and when the time came
for a final accounting he told himself that he would settle both. He knew there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295'></a>295</span> would come such a
time. From the beginning he had felt that he and the Circle Cross manager were
marked by fate for a clash. He was eager for it, but content to wait until the
appointed time. And he knew that the time was not far distant.</p>

<p>Therefore he remained silent regarding the incident, and except to Norton and
his wife, Nellie Hazelton, Ten Spot, and himself, the disappearance of Yuma
remained a mystery.</p>

<p>Dunlavey, perhaps, might have had his suspicions, but if so he communicated
them to no one, and so as the days passed the mystery ceased to be discussed and
Yuma was forgotten.</p>

<p>Hollis received a letter from Weary, dated &#8220;Chicago,&#8221; announcing
the safe arrival of himself and Ed Hazelton. &#8220;Town&#8221; suited him to a
&#8220;T,&#8221; he wrote. But Doctor Hammond would not operate at once&#8211;he
wanted time to study the symptoms of Ed&#8217;s malady. That was all. Hollis
turned this letter over to Nellie, with another from Ed, addressed to
her&#8211;whose contents remained a mystery to him.</p>

<p>Ben Allen had returned from his visit to the small ranchers in the vicinity,
had confided to Hollis that he had &#8220;mixed a little politics with
business,&#8221; and then, after receiving a telegram from the Secretary of the
Interior, had taken <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_296'></a>296</span> himself off to Santa Fe to confer with the
governor.</p>

<p>After several days he returned. He entered the <i>Kicker</i> office to greet
Hollis, his face wreathed in smiles.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got &#8217;em all stirred up, my boy!&#8221; he declared,
placing his hand on Hollis&#8217;s shoulder with a resounding
&#8220;smack&#8221;; &#8220;they&#8217;re goin&#8217; to enforce the little law
we&#8217;ve got and they&#8217;ve passed some new ones. Here&#8217;s a few!
First and foremost, cattle stealing is to be considered felony! Penalty, from
one to twenty years! Next&#8211;free water! Being as the rivers in this
Territory ain&#8217;t never been sold with what land the government sharks has
disposed of, any cattleman&#8217;s got the right to water wherever he wants to.
The governor told me that if it&#8217;s necessary he&#8217;ll send Uncle
Sam&#8217;s blue coats anywhere in the Territory to enforce that! Third: after a
man&#8217;s registered his brand he can&#8217;t change it unless he applies to
the district judge. Them that ain&#8217;t registered their brand ain&#8217;t
entitled to no protection. I reckon there&#8217;s trouble ahead for any man
which monkeys with another man&#8217;s brand!</p>

<p>&#8220;Say!&#8221; Allen eyed Hollis whimsically; &#8220;that new
governor&#8217;s all het up over you! Had a copy of the <i>Kicker</i> in front
of him on his desk <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297'></a>297</span>
when he was talkin&#8217; to me. Says you&#8217;re a scrapper from the word go,
an&#8217; that he&#8217;d back you up long as there was a blue coat anywhere in
the Territory!&#8221;</p>

<p>Allen&#8217;s speech was ungrammatical, but its message was one of good cheer
and Hollis&#8217;s eyes brightened. The Law was coming at last! He could not
help but wonder what Dunlavey&#8217;s feelings would be when he heard of it. For
himself, he felt as any man must feel who, laboring at a seemingly impossible
task, endless and thankless, sees in the distance the possible, the end, and the
plaudits of his friends.</p>

<p>Yes, he could see the end, but the end was not yet. He looked gravely at
Allen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you happen to hear when these laws become effective?&#8221; he
inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the first day of October!&#8221; returned Allen, triumphantly.</p>

<p>Hollis smiled. &#8220;And election day is the third of
November,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That gives Dunlavey, Watkins and Company a
month&#8217;s grace&#8211;in case you are elected sheriff.&#8221;</p>

<p>Allen grinned. &#8220;They can&#8217;t do a heap in a month,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; returned Hollis, &#8220;but in most elections that have
come under my observation, I have noticed that the winning candidate does not
assume <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298'></a>298</span> office for
a considerable time after the election. What is the custom out here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Allen grinned grimly. &#8220;Usually it&#8217;s two weeks,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;but if I&#8217;m elected it will be the next day&#8211;if I have to go
down to the sheriff&#8217;s office and drag Bill Watkins out by the
hair!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That belligerent spirit does you credit,&#8221; dryly observed Hollis.
&#8220;It will afford me great pleasure to participate in the festivities. But
there is another matter to be thought of&#8211;which we seem to have overlooked.
Usually before an election there is a primary, or a convention, is there
not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is,&#8221; grinned Allen. &#8220;It&#8217;s to-night, and
I&#8217;m ready for it!&#8221; His grin expanded to a wide, whimsical smile.
&#8220;I told you that I&#8217;d been mixing a little politics with
business,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve done so.&#8221; He got up and
approached the front window of the office, sweeping a hand toward the street.
&#8220;If you&#8217;ll just get up and look out here,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;you&#8217;ll see that I ain&#8217;t lying. There&#8217;s some good in
being an ex-office-holder&#8211;you get experience enough to tell you how to run
a campaign.&#8221; He bowed to Hollis. &#8220;Now, if you&#8217;ll look close at
that gang which is mixing palaver in front of the Silver Dollar you&#8217;ll
mebbe notice that Lemuel Train is in it, an&#8217; Truxton, of the Diamond Dot,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299'></a>299</span> Holcomb, of the
Star, Yeager, of the Three Diamond, Clark, of the Circle Y, Henningson, of the
Three Bar, Toban, of the T Down, an&#8217; some more which has come in for the
racket tonight. Countin&#8217; &#8217;em all&#8211;the punchers which have come
in with the fellows I have named&#8211;there&#8217;ll be about seventy-five.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217;, say!&#8221; he added, suddenly confronting Hollis and
grasping him by the shoulder and shaking him playfully and admiringly,
&#8220;there wouldn&#8217;t a durn one of them have come over here on my
account. They up an&#8217; told me so when I asked them. Said they&#8217;d
nothin&#8217; ag&#8217;in me, but they wasn&#8217;t considerin&#8217;
votin&#8217; at all. But since Hollis wanted me&#8211;well, they&#8217;d come
over just to show you that they appreciated what you&#8217;d done for
them!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis smiled. He did not tell Allen that since the appearance of the
<i>Kicker</i> containing the announcement that he was to be its candidate he had
written every small rancher in the vicinity, requesting as a personal favor that
they appear in Dry Bottom on the day of the primary; that these letters had been
delivered by Ace, and that when the poet returned he had presented Hollis with a
list containing the name of every rancher who had promised to come, and that
several days before Hollis had known approximately <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_300'></a>300</span> how many votes Allen would receive at
the primary. He did not intend that Allen should know this&#8211;or that he had
been going quietly from one Dry Bottom merchant to another, appealing to them
for their support. And the earnestness with which many of them had promised had
convinced him that the primary was to be the beginning of the end for Bill
Watkins and Dunlavey.</p>

<p>When he had first come to Dry Bottom it had been universally conceded by the
town&#8217;s citizens that his differences with Dunlavey and the
Cattlemen&#8217;s Association were purely personal, and there had been a
disposition on the part of the citizens to let them fight it out between
themselves. But of late there had come a change in that sentiment. The change
had been gradual, beginning with the day when he had told the author of the
notice that had appeared on the door of the <i>Kicker</i> office not to hold the
express on his account. But the change had come and it was evident that it was
to be permanent. It had only been necessary to arouse the government to the
situation in order to secure intervention. He had hoped to secure this
intervention without being forced to a hostile clash with the opposition, but
his first meeting with Dunlavey had spoiled that. Subsequent events had widened
the breach.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301'></a>301</span>He was
satisfied. Let Bill Watkins be defeated for sheriff and Dunlavey was beaten. But
there was much to be done before that desirable end could be achieved.</p>

<p>Following the custom the primary was to be held in the sheriff&#8217;s
office. Watkins had issued a proclamation some weeks before; it had appeared on
the door of the sheriff&#8217;s office&#8211;a written notice, tacked to the
door&#8211;but it had been removed the same day. Obviously, it was the
sheriff&#8217;s intention to conduct the primary as quietly as possible, hoping
no doubt to disarm whatever opposition might develop. But Hollis had been
apprised of the appearance of the proclamation and had quietly proceeded to
plant the seed of opposition to Watkins in the minds of his friends.</p>

<p>He had been warned by Judge Graney that Watkins would try to
&#8220;pack&#8221; the sheriff&#8217;s office with his friends on the night of
the primary. This had been the usual method employed by Dunlavey when opposition
to Watkins developed. Drunken, dissolute, dangerous men were usually on hand to
overawe the opposition; the Judge told of instances in which gunplay had
developed. But Hollis had determined that Watkins must be beaten.</p>

<p>Allen did not stay long in the <i>Kicker</i> office. Nor, for that matter,
did Hollis. Once, during <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_302'></a>302</span> the morning, he went down to the court house to
talk with Judge Graney. Then he returned to the <i>Kicker</i> office and worked
until noon.</p>

<p>During the morning there had been a surprising influx of visitors. Bronzed
punchers on dusty, drooping ponies rode down the town&#8217;s one street,
dropped from their saddles, and sought the saloons. Groups of them swarmed the
streets and the stores. As Hollis walked down to his office after leaving the
court house, he was kept busy nodding to friends&#8211;many of whom had become
such during the later days of the drought. Merchants grinned at him from their
doorways; Dunlavey&#8217;s friends sneered as he passed or sent ribald jokes
after him.</p>

<p>At noon he went to the Alhambra for lunch. Almost the first person he saw
there was Dunlavey. The latter grinned at him mockingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Friends of yours in town to-day,&#8221; he said with a sneer.
&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ll need them!&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice had been loud enough for all in the restaurant to hear. Hollis did
not answer, though he appreciated the significance of Dunlavey&#8217;s words;
they told him that the Circle Cross manager was aware of the contemplated
contest and was ready for it.</p>

<p>During the afternoon Dry Bottom presented a decidedly different appearance
from the day <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303'></a>303</span> when
Hollis had first viewed it. Animation had succeeded desolation. Perhaps a
hundred cowponies were hitched to the rails that paralleled the fronts of the
saloons, the stores, and many of the private dwellings. It was apparent that
many of the visitors had made the trip to town for the double purpose of voting
and securing supplies, for mixed with the ponies were numerous wagons of various
varieties, their owners loading them with boxes and crates. Men swarmed the
sidewalks; the saloons buzzed.</p>

<p>Toward dusk the volume of noise in the saloons drowned all sound outside.
Having made their purchases the ranchers who had driven in for supplies and had
loaded their wagons preparatory to departure found time to join their friends
and acquaintances over a convivial glass. By the time the kerosene lamps were
lighted in the saloons revelry reigned. From one saloon issued the shrieking,
discordant notes of a violin, accompanied by the scuffling of feet; from another
came laughter and the clinking of glasses; from still another came harsh oaths
and obscene shouts. In the latter place rose the laughter of women.</p>

<p>Seated at his desk near the front window of the <i>Kicker</i> office Hollis
gravely watched the scene&#8211;listened to the sounds. In another chair <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304'></a>304</span> sat Potter. There was no
light in the office; neither man had thought of a light. As the revelry in the
saloons increased the printer glanced furtively at his chief.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be hell to-night!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect there will be trouble,&#8221; agreed Hollis.</p>

<p>Potter shifted uneasily in his chair, eyeing his employer with a worried
expression. He was silent for a moment. Then he cleared his throat
nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you intend to go there&#8211;to the sheriff&#8217;s
office&#8211;to-night?&#8221; he questioned.</p>

<p>Hollis looked quickly at him. &#8220;Of course!&#8221; he said with emphasis.
&#8220;Why?&#8221; he interrogated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; returned Potter; &#8220;only&#8213;&#8221; he
hesitated and then blurted out: &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t go if I were you.
They&#8217;ve been saying that if you do there&#8217;ll be trouble. You know
what that means.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who has been saying that?&#8221; inquired Hollis.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard it at noon&#8211;in the Silver Dollar. Some of
Dunlavey&#8217;s men sat near me and I heard them saying that Watkins was to win
if they had to put two or three of his chief opponents out of
business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been expecting that,&#8221; returned Hollis. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305'></a>305</span> He said nothing more and
Potter, having done his duty, felt that he had no business to interfere
further.</p>

<p>Shortly after dark there was a clatter of hoofs outside the <i>Kicker</i>
office and four men dismounted from their ponies and strode to the office door.
They were Norton, Ace, Lanky, and Bud. Evidently Hollis had been awaiting their
coming, for he met them at the door, greeting them with the words:
&#8220;We&#8217;ll be going at once; it&#8217;s about time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Followed by Potter the five strode rapidly down the street. When they arrived
at the sheriff&#8217;s office there were a number of men congregated about the
door. Inside a kerosene lamp flickered on a table that sat in the center of the
room. Another lamp stood on Watkins&#8217;s desk, and beside the desk sat
Watkins himself.</p>

<p>Conversation died away as Hollis and his men approached the door and stood in
the stream of light from the interior. A man stepped out of the shadow of the
building and approached Hollis, drawing him and Norton aside. It was Allen. The
latter had lost some of the sprightliness that had marked his manner during his
conversation with Hollis in the <i>Kicker</i> office that morning&#8211;he was
again the cool, deliberate, steady-eyed man he had been that day in Judge <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306'></a>306</span> Graney&#8217;s office
when Hollis had met him the first time.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been waitin&#8217; for you,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;we&#8217;re goin&#8217; to have a scrumptuous time. Dunlavey&#8217;s
planning to pack her.&#8221; He swept a hand toward the interior of the office.
&#8220;But each candidate is to be allowed two witnesses. I&#8217;ve selected
you two. Dunlavey and Greasy are doing the honors for Watkins. We might just as
well go inside; we can&#8217;t do anything out here. There won&#8217;t be
anything done by any of this gang until Dunlavey says the word.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned and stepped into the sheriff&#8217;s office, Hollis and Norton
following.</p>

<p>Watkins looked up and surveyed them with a bland smile as they entered and
dropped quietly into the several chairs that had been provided.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon she&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be some hot tonight?&#8221;
significantly remarked Watkins, addressing himself to Allen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; grinned Allen.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re goin&#8217; to take a hand in handlin&#8217; the
Law,&#8221; significantly remarked Norton.</p>

<p>Watkins&#8217;s face reddened. He stared offensively at Hollis.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon you&#8217;re a witness, too,&#8221; he said, sneering.
&#8220;Well,&#8221; he went on as Hollis gravely nodded, &#8220;the law says
that a witness to the count <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_307'></a>307</span> must be a resident of the county. An&#8217; I
reckon you ain&#8217;t. You ain&#8217;t been&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He stays,&#8221; interrupted Allen, shortly. &#8220;That&#8217;s
settled.&#8221;</p>

<p>Watkins&#8217;s face bloated with a sudden anger, but he wheeled without
replying and gave his attention to some papers lying on the desk in front of
him.</p>

<p>For a long time the four sat in silence. Outside arose voices of
men&#8211;growing in volume. There was a jam around the door; looking out Hollis
could see the bronzed, grim faces of the punchers as they crowded close, moved
by a spirit of curiosity. Hollis could hear exclamations of impatience, though
the majority of the men outside stood in silence, waiting.</p>

<p>Plainly, nothing was to be done until the arrival of Dunlavey. And presently
he came.</p>

<p>He had not been drinking; he was undeniably sober and self-possessed. As he
entered the door of the office there was a sudden surge on the part of the
crowd&#8211;several of the men tried to force their way in behind Dunlavey. But
he halted on the threshold, scowling back at them and uttering the one word:
&#8220;Wait!&#8221; The crowd fell back at the command and watched.</p>

<p>Dunlavey stepped across the room, standing beside Watkins, his rapid glance
noting the presence <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_308'></a>308</span> of the three members of the opposition. He ignored
Hollis and Norton, speaking to Allen.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re sure enough going to run?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; returned Allen. He rose slowly, stepped deliberately
across the room, closed the door, and stood with his back to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all here now,&#8221; he said quietly, &#8220;and I want to
talk a little. There ain&#8217;t no one going to hear what I&#8217;ve got to say
but them I&#8217;m going to say it to. I reckon that goes?&#8221; He turned to
Dunlavey.</p>

<p>Dunlavey had shown some evidence of surprise over Allen&#8217;s action in
closing the door, but this immediately gave way to a sneer of mockery. &#8220;I
reckon you&#8217;ve forgot Greasy,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I sure have!&#8221; returned Allen evenly. He opened the door a
trifle and called: &#8220;Greasy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Evidently Greasy had been waiting at the door, for he immediately came in,
slouching across the floor and standing beside Watkins and Dunlavey. Allen
closed the door and adjusted the fastenings carefully. Then he turned again to
Dunlavey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we&#8217;ll proceed to do the talking,&#8221; he said. He walked
over to the chair that he had <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_309'></a>309</span> previously vacated, dropping carelessly into it and
leaning comfortably back. His movements had been those of a man unquestionably
sure of peace. The expression of his eyes, the tones of his voice, his
deliberation hinted at a desire for a peaceful compromise.</p>

<p>But once seated in his chair a startling change came over him. There was a
rapid movement at his sides, a mere flash of light, and two heavy six-shooters
appeared suddenly in his hands and lay there, unaimed, but forbiddingly ready.
He sat erect, his eyes chilled and glittering, alert, filled with menace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said sharply, &#8220;the first man who peeps above a
whisper gets his so plenty that he won&#8217;t care a damn who&#8217;s nominated
for sheriff!&#8221; He spoke to Norton and Hollis without turning his head.
&#8220;You two get whatever guns them gentlemen happen to have on them, standing
to one side so&#8217;s I can see to perforate anyone who ain&#8217;t agreeable
to handing them over.&#8221;</p>

<p>Norton rose and approached Dunlavey, while Hollis stepped forward to the
sheriff and secured the weapon that reposed in a holster at his right hip. He
did likewise with Greasy. While Norton was relieving Dunlavey of his weapon the
sheriff opened his lips to speak, his gaze fixed doubtfully on one of
Allen&#8217;s sixes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310'></a>310</span>&#8220;The
law&#8213;&#8221; he began. But Allen interrupted with a grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the law didn&#8217;t figure on this. But
I reckon you heard Big Bill say once that the law could be handled. I&#8217;m
handling it now. But I reckon that lets you out&#8211;you ain&#8217;t in on this
and the mourners&#8217;ll be after you to-morrow if you open your trap
again!&#8221;</p>

<p>The sheriff swelled with rage, but he closed his lips tightly. When Hollis
and Norton had completed their search for weapons and had laid the result of
their search on the table near Allen they sought their chairs.</p>

<p>Dunlavey had said nothing. He stood beside Watkins&#8217;s desk, still
self-possessed, the mocking smile still on his face, though into his eyes had
come a doubting, worried expression. Plainly he had not anticipated such drastic
action from Allen.</p>

<p>The latter laughed grimly, quietly. &#8220;Sort of unexpected, wasn&#8217;t
it, Bill?&#8221; he said, addressing Dunlavey. &#8220;It ain&#8217;t just the
sort of politics that you&#8217;ve been used to. But I&#8217;m kind of used to
it myself. Had to pull the same game off over in Colfax County when I was
runnin&#8217; for sheriff the first time. It worked, too, because the folks that
was mixed up in it knowed I wasn&#8217;t ringing in any bluff.&#8221; He looked
at Dunlavey <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311'></a>311</span> with a
level, steady gaze, his eyes gleaming coldly. &#8220;If you think I&#8217;m
bluffing now, chirp for some one of your pluguglies to bust into this game.
I&#8217;d sort of like to let off my campaign guns into your dirty
gizzard!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis had been watching Dunlavey closely. There was no fear in the
man&#8217;s eyes; even the doubt and worry that had been there had disappeared
and his expression was now mildly ironical, contrasting oddly with the demeanor
of Watkins&#8211;who was plainly frightened&#8211;and that of Greasy&#8211;who
smirked and showed his teeth like some beast at bay and in fear of death. It was
evident that Dunlavey possessed the spirit of the fighter, that indomitable
courage which enables a man to face any situation and still retain his presence
of mind, which permits him to face death unafraid and unyielding. In spite of
the enmity that had existed between them from the beginning, Hollis had always
respected Dunlavey for these very qualities, and within the last few minutes
that respect had grown.</p>

<p>Dunlavey&#8217;s eyes gleamed as he looked at Allen. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
think you would try to work any bluff on me, Allen,&#8221; he said quietly.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve took me by surprise, that&#8217;s a fact. But let&#8217;s
get down to business. What&#8217;s your game?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon that&#8217;s a sensible way to look at it,&#8221; <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312'></a>312</span> returned Allen evenly.
&#8220;That&#8217;s the way I expected you&#8217;d look at it when you begun to
realize that I was holding some pretty good cards. There ain&#8217;t nothing
personal in this; I&#8217;m out for a square deal and I&#8217;m going to get it.
I want you to understand that I&#8217;m running this game to-night and I&#8217;m
running it square. If I get enough votes I&#8217;m going to be the next sheriff.
If I don&#8217;t get enough votes Bill Watkins&#8217;ll be it. But the votes are
going to be real votes. I ain&#8217;t figuring on letting your gang pack in here
and keep my friends from voting.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to put your hat on this table. Then Norton will open
the door and let one man come in. That man will vote&#8211;for whoever he
pleases. Then Mr. Hollis will let him out the back door and Norton will let
another man in the front. There won&#8217;t be any row. I&#8217;m telling you
that you and Bill Watkins and Greasy are going to set here and watch the voting.
I&#8217;m going to stand behind you with one of my guns tucked under your fifth
rib. If you, or Watkins, or Greasy let out a yawp that can be construed as a
signal for anyone to bust into the game, or if there&#8217;s anything started by
your friends which ain&#8217;t your doing, I&#8217;m going to pump six chunks of
lead into you so fast that they&#8217;ll be playing tag with one another going
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313'></a>313</span> through. I reckon
you get me. That ends the palaver.&#8221;</p>

<p>He arose, snatched Dunlavey&#8217;s hat from his head, placed it on the
table, and walked behind Dunlavey, standing against the wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Open the door!&#8221; he directed, looking at Norton.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314'></a>314</span><a id='link_25'></a>CHAPTER XXV<br /><span class='h2fs'>HANDLING THE LAW</span></h2>

<p>Norton opened the door a trifle and called &#8220;One man at a time!&#8221;
There were some hoarse shouts from without&#8211;presumably from
Dunlavey&#8217;s friends; a chorus of derisive laughter from Allen&#8217;s. Then
the first man entered.</p>

<p>It was Ace. The poet stood for an instant, blinking at the light, then he
grinned as his gaze rested on the occupants of the room. He was directed how to
cast his ballot. He took the piece of paper that was given him by Norton,
scrawled &#8220;Allen&#8221; across it with a pencil that Norton had previously
placed on the table, and dropped the paper into Dunlavey&#8217;s hat. Hollis
opened the rear door for him, but he halted on the threshold, looking back into
the room with a broad grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gawd A&#8217;mighty!&#8221; he said in an awed tone; &#8220;there must
have been a wad of money blowed in in this here town to-day! Drunks! Man alive
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315'></a>315</span> there ain&#8217;t
nothin&#8217; but drunks; the town&#8217;s reelin&#8217; with &#8217;em!
They&#8217;re layin&#8217; in the street; there&#8217;s a dozen in the Silver
Dollar an&#8217; that many more in the Fashion&#8211;an&#8217; Gawd knows how
many more in the other saloons. Their heads is under the tables; they&#8217;re
hangin&#8217; on the walls an&#8217; clawin&#8217; around in
spittoons&#8211;gle-or-i-ously, be-ut-i-fully paralyzed!&#8221;</p>

<p>He was suddenly outside, pushed through the door by Hollis, and the door
closed after him. Hollis glanced furtively at Dunlavey to see that gentleman
scowl. He thought he saw a questioning glint in Allen&#8217;s eyes as the latter
looked suddenly at him, but he merely smiled and gave his attention to the next
man, who was now entering.</p>

<p>The latter proved to be Lemuel Train. He did his voting quietly and grimly.
But as he went out through the door that Hollis opened for him he growled:
&#8220;Lordy, what a drunken bunch!&#8221; He looked at Hollis. &#8220;One of
your men, too,&#8221; he said, grinning slightly. &#8220;I thought you taught
them better!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis frowned. He knew that Allen would need all his friends; none of them
could be spared in this crisis. He smiled incredulously. It had been only a
short time before that his men had accompanied him to the door of the
sheriff&#8217;s <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316'></a>316</span>
office. At that time they were perfectly sober. It would have been impossible
for any of them&#8211;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; Ten Spot&#8217;s a hummer when he gits started,&#8221; Train
was saying. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen him before when he cut loose an&#8217; he
sure is a holy terror!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then with a word of parting Train was gone, saying that he had done all the
&#8220;damage&#8221; he could and that he purposed &#8220;hitting&#8221; the
trail back to his ranch.</p>

<p>He had certainly done some damage to Hollis. The latter&#8217;s mind now
rioted with all sorts of conjecture and he mechanically did his work of letting
man after man out through the rear door, scarcely seeing them.</p>

<p>He was aware of an odd expression that had come into Dunlavey&#8217;s eyes at
the mention of Ten Spot. Had Dunlavey succeeded in bribing Ten Spot to desert
him? He had left Ten Spot at the Circle Bar, not inviting him to Dry Bottom
because he felt that the latter would rather not come since he had deserted
Dunlavey. And Ten Spot had come to town anyway. What did it mean? Did it mean
that Ten Spot had come to assist Dunlavey in nominating Watkins and defeating
his new employer?</p>

<p>He frowned again, and for the next few minutes gravely studied
Dunlavey&#8217;s face. He was <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_317'></a>317</span> sure that the latter&#8217;s manner had changed.
The mocking smile which had been on his face since his arrival at the
sheriff&#8217;s office had been superseded by a huge grin&#8211;plainly of
anticipation. Ten Spot&#8211;dangerous, reckless, drunk, at the head of a number
of dissolute men, had it in his power to make things decidedly interesting
should he advance on the sheriff&#8217;s office with the intention of assisting
Dunlavey.</p>

<p>Several times since hiring Ten Spot Hollis had doubted him. The suspicion had
assailed him that perhaps the appearance of Ten Spot at the Hazelton cabin so
opportunely had been a part of a plot by Dunlavey to place a spy in his employ.
They might have purposely sacrificed Yuma.</p>

<p>During the next quarter of an hour he gave more attention to Dunlavey than to
the steady stream of men that passed through the room, though he recognized a
goodly number as friends he had made during the latter days of the drought.</p>

<p>Allen&#8217;s spirits had risen during the last quarter of an hour. His
maneuver had dissipated Dunlavey&#8217;s strength and it was plain to be seen
that a majority of the votes cast were for him. If nothing unusual or unexpected
happened within the next hour, or until nine o&#8217;clock, the hour <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318'></a>318</span> named in Watkins&#8217;s
proclamation for the closing of the polls, he was assured of victory.</p>

<p>Thoughts of the same character were passing through Hollis&#8217;s mind.
There was silence in the office. A man was voting at the table&#8211;writing his
favorite&#8217;s name on a piece of paper. Hollis consulted his watch. It lacked
over an hour of the time for closing. The man at the table finished writing and
tossed the paper into the hat. Hollis opened the rear door to allow him to go
out. While the door remained open a sound floated in, which they all
heard&#8211;an ear-splitting screech, followed instantly by a chorus of yells, a
pistol report, more yells, and then a number of reports.</p>

<p>Norton did not open the door. He exchanged glances with Hollis and Allen.
Dunlavey grinned widely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something&#8217;s coming,&#8221; remarked Allen grimly.</p>

<p>Dunlavey&#8217;s grin grew derisive. &#8220;It would sure be too bad if my
friends should bust up this peace meeting,&#8221; he sneered.</p>

<p>&#8220;There won&#8217;t be nothin&#8217; spoiled,&#8221; grimly assured
Allen. But he drew his other six-shooter.</p>

<p>The sounds outside grew in volume as they swept toward the sheriff&#8217;s
office. They broke presently at the door and an ominous silence succeeded. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319'></a>319</span> Then a voice reached the
interior&#8211;harsh authoritative&#8211;Ten Spot&#8217;s voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Open up, you damned shorthorns!&#8221; it said.</p>

<p>Norton looked at Allen. The latter&#8217;s face was pale. &#8220;They come
in,&#8221; he directed, &#8220;like the others&#8211;one at a time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Norton carefully withdrew the bar with which the door was fastened, swinging
it open slightly. As he did so there was a sudden rush of bodies; Norton tried
to jam the door shut, failed, and was flung back several steps by the surging,
yelling crowd that piled tumultuously into the room.</p>

<p>There were perhaps twenty of them and as they surged into the room, shouting
and cursing and laughing Hollis recognized among them many men that he had come
to know by sight. They were of the reckless, lawless element upon which Dunlavey
had relied for his support&#8211;men of Ten Spot&#8217;s character. They had
been drinking, but in spite of their laughter and loud talking it was plain to
be seen that they had determined not to be balked in the purpose which had
brought them into the office.</p>

<p>There was now no need to guard the door; the damage had been wrought, and
Norton backed away, leaving the door ajar, pale, grim eyed, alert, ready to take
an active part in the trouble which he felt certain was sure to develop.
Something <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320'></a>320</span> in the
faces of the men who had come in with Ten Spot proclaimed trouble.</p>

<p>Allen had not moved. He still stood behind Dunlavey, but his weapons no
longer menaced the Circle Cross manager; their muzzles, level and forbidding,
were covering the other men.</p>

<p>Standing quietly beside the rear door, his face pale, his eyes bright, his
lips in straight lines, Hollis watched closely as the visitors, having gained
entrance, gathered together in the center of the room. They were not awed by
Allen&#8217;s weapons; they grinned hugely at him. One man, a young man of about
Hollis&#8217;s age, bronzed, lean, reckless of eye, and unmistakably under the
influence of liquor, lunged forward to Allen and stood within arm&#8217;s length
of him, grinning at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two guns!&#8221; he said with a laugh. &#8220;Why, I reckon
you&#8217;d make a hell of a sheriff!&#8221;</p>

<p>A chorus of laughter greeted the young cowboy&#8217;s words. Dunlavey grinned
widely. &#8220;You boys are just in time,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>There was another roar of laughter. Many of the men seemed only now to have
become aware of Dunlavey&#8217;s presence and they surged forward around him,
disregarding Allen&#8217;s guns. The latter seemed to realize that the situation
had passed beyond his control, for catching Hollis&#8217;s <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_321'></a>321</span> eye he smiled grimly and sheathed his
weapons, seeking Hollis&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use,&#8221; he said shortly to Hollis as he came near;
&#8220;they&#8217;ll run things to suit themselves now. I wasn&#8217;t
expectin&#8217; Ten Spot to butt into the game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon they&#8217;ve got us.&#8221; Norton had also sought
Hollis&#8217;s side and the three stood near the rear door, watching the crowd
around Dunlavey. Hollis tried to catch Ten Spot&#8217;s gaze but
failed&#8211;the latter seemed studiously to avoid him.</p>

<p>A wave of dull anger surged through Hollis&#8217;s veins. Until now the
contest had been conducted fairly; they had given Dunlavey and Watkins an honest
election, even though they had found it necessary to eliminate them as active
participants. From now on he was assured the contest would be a
joke&#8211;though a grim one. He had depended upon Allen&#8217;s
success&#8211;it meant much to him. The thought of failure just when victory was
within his grasp aroused him and in spite of Norton&#8217;s low word of caution
he stepped forward and stood beside the table on which reposed the hat into
which the ballots had been placed by the men who had previously voted. He
intended to take personal charge of the hat, determined upon securing a fair
deal in spite of the great odds.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322'></a>322</span>As he stepped
forward he saw Greasy grin maliciously and try to snatch a gun from the holster
of a cowboy who stood near him. This attempt was frustrated by the puncher, who
suddenly dropped his hand to his holster, where it closed upon Greasy&#8217;s.
The puncher snarled, muttered profanely, and struck furiously at Greasy,
knocking him down in a corner.</p>

<p>Other men moved. There were curses; the flashing of metal as guns came out.
Hollis felt rather than saw Norton and Allen advance toward the table and stand
beside him. A grim smile wreathed his face over the knowledge that in the crowd
there were at least two men upon whom he might depend to the end&#8211;whatever
the end might be.</p>

<p>He heard Dunlavey snarl an oath, saw his big form loom out of the crowd, saw
one of his gigantic hands reach for the hat on the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon I&#8217;ll take charge of this now!&#8221; he sneered, his
brutal face close to Hollis&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Hollis would have struck the face that was so close to his, but at the
instant he saw Dunlavey&#8217;s hand reach out for the hat he saw another hand
dart out from the other side of the table, seize the hat, and draw it out of
Dunlavey&#8217;s reach.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t reckon that you&#8217;ll take charge of her!&#8221; said
a voice.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323'></a>323</span>Hollis turned
quickly. Over the table leaned Ten Spot, the captured hat in his hand, a big
forty-five in the other, a cold, evil glitter in his eyes as he looked up at
Dunlavey.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t reckon that you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to have a hand in
runnin&#8217; this show a-tall, Bill,&#8221; he sneered. &#8220;Me an&#8217; my
friends come down here special to tend to that.&#8221; He grinned the shallow,
hard grin that marks the passing of a friendship and the dawn of a bitter
hatred. &#8220;You see, Bill, me an&#8217; my friends has got sorta tired of the
way you&#8217;ve been runnin&#8217; things an&#8217; we&#8217;re shufflin&#8217;
the cards for a new deal. This here tenderfoot which you&#8217;ve been
a-slanderin&#8217; shameful is man&#8217;s size an&#8217; we&#8217;re
seein&#8217; that he gits a fair shake in this here. I reckon you git
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis felt Norton poking him in the ribs, but he did not turn; he was too
intent upon watching the two principal actors in the scene. Tragedy had been
imminent; comedy was slowly gaining the ascendency. For at the expression that
had come over Dunlavey&#8217;s face several of the men were grinning broadly.
Were the stakes not so great Hollis would have felt like smiling himself.
Dunlavey seemed stunned. He stood erect, passing his hand over his forehead as
though half convinced that the scene were an illusion and that the movement of
the hand would dispel it. Several <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_324'></a>324</span> times his lips moved, but no words came and he
turned, looking about at the men who were gathered around him, scanning their
faces for signs that would tell him that they were not in sympathy with Ten
Spot. But the faces that he looked upon wore mocking grins and sneers.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I&#8217;ve been tellin&#8217; the boys how you set Yuma on
Nellie Hazelton, an&#8217; they&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that a guy which
will play a low down mean game like that on a woman ain&#8217;t no fit guy to
have no hand in any law makin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ten Spot&#8217;s voice fell coldly and metallically in the silence of the
room. Slowly recovering from the shock Dunlavey attempted a sneer, which
gradually faded into a mirthless smile as Ten Spot continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; you ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to have a hand in any more
law-makin&#8217; in this man&#8217;s town. Me an&#8217; my friends is
goin&#8217; to see to that, an&#8217; my boss, Mr. Hollis. I reckon
that&#8217;ll be about all. You don&#8217;t need to hang around here while we do
the rest of the votin&#8217;. Watkins an&#8217; Greasy c&#8217;n stay to see
that everything goes on regular.&#8221; He grinned wickedly as Dunlavey
stiffened. &#8220;I reckon you know me, Bill. I ain&#8217;t palaverin&#8217;
none. You an&#8217; Ten Spot is quits!&#8221;</p>

<p>He stepped back a little, away from the table, his teeth showing in a mocking
grin. Then he <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325'></a>325</span>
looked down at the hat which he still held in his hand&#8211;Dunlavey&#8217;s
hat. He laughed. &#8220;Why, I&#8217;m cert&#8217;nly impolite!&#8221; he said
insinuatingly. &#8220;Here you&#8217;ve been wantin&#8217; to go an&#8217;
I&#8217;ve been keepin&#8217; your hat!&#8221; He dumped the ballots upon the
table and passed the hat to Dunlavey. Without a word Dunlavey took it, jerking
it savagely, placed it on his head, and strode to the door, stepping down into
the street.</p>

<p>There was a short silence. Then Ten Spot turned and looked at Hollis, his
face wreathed in a broad grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon you-all think you know somethin&#8217; about handlin&#8217;
the law,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but your little Ten Spot ain&#8217;t exactly the
measliest card in the deck! We&#8217;ll do our votin&#8217; now.&#8221;</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later, after Ten Spot and his friends had cast their
ballots and Watkins had been forced to make out a certificate of
nomination,&#8211;which reposed safely in Ben Allen&#8217;s inside
pocket&#8211;the kerosene lights were extinguished and the men filed out. Hollis
and Ten Spot were the last to leave. As they stood for a moment on the threshold
of the doorway Hollis seized Ten Spot&#8217;s hand and gripped it heartily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to thank you, my friend,&#8221; he said earnestly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326'></a>326</span>Ten Spot jerked
his hand away. &#8220;Aw, hell!&#8221; he said as they sought the darkness of
the street, &#8220;I ain&#8217;t mushin&#8217; none. But,&#8221; he added, as a
concession to his feelings, &#8220;I reckon to know a white man when I see
one!&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327'></a>327</span><a id='link_26'></a>CHAPTER XXVI<br /><span class='h2fs'>AUTUMN AND THE GODS</span></h2>

<p>It was Sunday afternoon and a hazy, golden, late September sun was swimming
lazily in the blue arc of sky, flooding the lower gallery of the Circle Bar
ranchhouse, but not reaching a secluded nook in which sat Hollis and Nellie
Hazelton. Mrs. Norton was somewhere in the house and Norton had gone down to the
bunkhouse for a talk with the men&#8211;Hollis and Nellie could see him, sitting
on a bench in the shade of the eaves, the other men gathered about him.</p>

<p>Below the broad level that stretched away from the ranchhouse sank the big
basin, sweeping away to the mountains. Miles into the distance the Circle Bar
cattle could be seen&#8211;moving dots in the center of a great, green bowl. To
the right Razor-Back ridge loomed its bald crest upward with no verdure saving
the fringe of shrubbery at its base; to the left stretched a vast plain that met
the distant horizon that stretched an <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_328'></a>328</span> interminable distance behind the cottonwood. Except
for the moving dots there was a total absence of life and movement in the big
basin. It spread in its wide, gradual, downward slope, bathed in the yellow
sunshine of the new, mellow season, peacefully slumberous, infinitely
beautiful.</p>

<p>Many times had Hollis sat in the gallery watching it, his eyes glistening,
his soul stirred to awe. Long since had he ceased regretting the glittering
tinsel of the cities of his recollection; they seemed artificial, unreal. When
he had first gazed out over the basin he had been oppressed with a sensation of
uneasiness. Its vastness had appalled him, its silence had aroused in him that
vague disquiet which is akin to fear. But these emotions had passed. He still
felt awed&#8211;he would always feel it, for it seemed that here he was looking
upon a section of the world in its primitive state; that in forming this world
the creator had been in his noblest mood&#8211;so far did the lofty mountains,
the wide, sweeping valleys, the towering buttes, and the mighty canyons dwarf
the flat hills and the puny shallows of the land he had known. But he was no
longer appalled; disquietude had been superseded by love.</p>

<p>It all seemed to hold some mystery for him&#8211;an <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_329'></a>329</span> alluring, soul-stirring mystery. The
tawny mountains, immutable guardians of the basin, whose peaks rose somberly in
the twilight glow&#8211;did they hold it? Or was it hidden in the basin, in the
great, green sweep that basked in the eternal sunlight?</p>

<p>Perhaps there was no mystery. Perhaps he felt merely the romance that would
inevitably come to one who deeply appreciated the beauty of a land into which he
had come so unwillingly? For romance was here.</p>

<p>He turned his head slightly and looked at the girl who sat beside him. She
also was looking out over the basin, her eyes filled with a light that thrilled
him. He studied her face long, noting the regular features, the slight tan,
through which shone the dusky bloom of perfect health; the golden brown hair,
with the wind-blown wisps straggling over her temples; he felt the
unaccountable, indefinable something that told him of her inborn innocence and
purity&#8211;qualities that he had worshiped ever since he had been old enough
to know the difference between right and wrong.</p>

<p>A deep respect moved him, a reverent smile wreathed his lips. Motherly? Yes,
that world-thrilling word aptly described her. And as he continued to look at
her he realized that this <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_330'></a>330</span> world held no mystery for him beyond that which was
enthroned in the heart of the girl who sat beside him, unconscious of his
thoughts.</p>

<p>He turned again toward the basin. He did not want to uncover the
mystery&#8211;yet. There were still several things to be done before he would
feel free to speak the words that he had meditated upon for some weeks.
Meanwhile&#8211;if the gods were with him&#8211;the solving of the mystery would
be the more enjoyable.</p>

<p>Two weeks of inaction had followed the primary incident. Several of Ten
Spot&#8217;s friends were now in his employ; in spite of the drought the Circle
Bar had so far experienced a very prosperous season, and, though the addition of
the men represented quite an item of expense, he felt that it was much better to
employ them than to allow them to be re-engaged by Dunlavey.</p>

<p>He had been able to save considerable money. This he had transferred to a
bank in Santa Fe, for he had determined to stay in the West. He had told his
mother of this decision and had asked her to come, but she had written that she
preferred to remain East for a time&#8211;at least until the following
spring.</p>

<p>Hollis was satisfied. Affairs were progressing beyond his anticipations.
Dunlavey&#8217;s influence <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_331'></a>331</span> in the county had received a mighty blow in the
defeat of Watkins at the primary; he had received notice of the enactment of
several new laws that would appreciably assist him in his fight; he had
succeeded in winning many friends because of his attitude on the water question;
the increased number of advertisements appearing in the <i>Kicker</i> would soon
necessitate the addition of an extra sheet. It all presaged prosperity. Yes, he
was satisfied. And yet&#8211;</p>

<p>He turned again and looked at the girl. This time he caught her watching him.
Evidently she had been watching him for a long time for her gaze was fixed and
meditative, as though she had been studying him. She started and blushed when he
turned and caught her, looking down in sudden and complete confusion. But she
looked up again instantly, meeting his gaze steadily, her lips in a frank
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been thinking of this country,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have guessed it,&#8221; he returned gravely and gently; &#8220;I
have been thinking of this country&#8211;and its people.&#8221; He smiled at
her, his eyes shining with a light that caused hers to waver and droop.
&#8220;But how did you discover that?&#8221; he questioned. &#8220;I was not
aware that I had been speaking my thoughts.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332'></a>332</span>&#8220;Do you
think it is always necessary to speak?&#8221; she answered, looking at him with
a quiet smile. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think there are times when one&#8217;s
thoughts find expression in one&#8217;s eyes? When we can not conceal
them&#8211;no matter how hard we try? I know that you were thinking of the
country,&#8221; she went on earnestly, &#8220;because a few moments ago I had
been thinking of it too and I know that my emotions were exactly the same as
those expressed in your eyes. It is magnificent, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; she said
in an awed, eager voice. &#8220;It is so big, so mighty, so soul-stirring. It
allures with its vastness, it dazzles with its beauty; it makes one feel closer
to the Creator, even while pressing home a disquieting sense of one&#8217;s own
insignificance.</p>

<p>&#8220;For instance,&#8221; she went on, her eyes large and luminous, a new,
quiet color coming into her face &#8220;there are times when our tasks seem
stupendous, when we are filled with an overpowering consciousness of the
importance of them; when we feel that we are carrying such a burden that the
addition of another would make the load too heavy. Then we look upon God&#8217;s
work and immediately a still, small voice within us cries: &#8216;What have ye done in
comparison to this?&#8217; And what have we done?&#8221; she suddenly
demanded.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_333'></a>333</span>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; he returned gravely, awed by
this fleeting illuminating glimpse into her soul.</p>

<p>She leaned back into her chair with a smile. &#8220;Those were the things I
was thinking about. And you, too, were thinking of them,&#8221; she added.
&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t deny it!&#8221; she warned, &#8220;for I saw it in your
eyes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; he said with a quick smile; &#8220;I don&#8217;t deny it.
But I was thinking of the people also.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the people!&#8221; she said with a frown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I should have said &#8216;person,&#8217;&#8221; he modified with a
quick glance at her, under which her eyes drooped in swift confusion&#8211;as
they had drooped on another occasion which he remembered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she said merely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been comparing this person to God&#8217;s other works,&#8221;
he said, a light in his eyes which told that the former decision to postpone an
attempt to uncover the mystery had been ruthlessly put aside, &#8220;and I have
come to the conclusion that in spite of the infinite care he took in forming the
beautiful world out yonder he did not neglect this person to whom I
refer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes met his in a glance of swift comprehension. She drew a slow, deep
breath and averted her face, which was now crimson.</p>

<p>&#8220;As you have been able to illustrate man&#8217;s <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_334'></a>334</span> insignificance in comparison to
God&#8217;s mighty creations, so has my own inferiority been forced upon me by
my attempting to compare myself to the sweet character of the person of whom I
speak,&#8221; said Hollis, his voice low and earnest. &#8220;It has been a
question whether&#8211;when I speak to her of a thing which has been on my mind
for many days&#8211;she could not with justice paraphrase the question asked by
the still, small voice and say: What have you done to deserve this? And I should
have to reply&#8211;nothing.&#8221; He had moved closer to her, leaning forward
to look into her eyes.</p>

<p>She sat very still, her gaze on the basin. &#8220;Perhaps this very estimable
person holds other views?&#8221; she returned, with a flash of mischief in her
eyes. She turned suddenly and looked straight at him, meeting his gaze
unwaveringly, a demure smile on her face. &#8220;I told you that sometimes a
person&#8217;s thoughts were expressed in their eyes,&#8221; she said&#8211;and
now her lashes flickered&#8211;&#8220;perhaps you can tell what my thoughts
are?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a challenge, a defiance, and an unconditional surrender. Like a flash
one of Hollis&#8217;s arms went out&#8211;she was drawn, vainly protesting,
toward him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t answered,&#8221; she laughed, in a <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335'></a>335</span> smothered voice;
&#8220;you are not certain&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not finish the sentence. Mrs. Norton, coming to the door for a breath
of fresh air, halted on the threshold, looked, smiled, and then
quietly&#8211;very quietly&#8211;slipped back into the house.</p>

<p>Away out over the basin a Mexican eagle circled, winging his slow way through
the golden sunshine of the afternoon. Miles away the mountain peaks rose
somberly, a mysterious, golden halo rising slowly above them. Perhaps there
would always be mystery in the mountains, but a certain mystery that had
troubled Hollis mightily had been successfully solved. The gods had favored
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;This here town,&#8221;&#8211;read a letter that Hollis received from

<p class='tar'>&#8220;Weary.</p>

<p>&#8220;P. S. id like to be home for the round-up but reckon i wont make
it.</p>

<p class='tar'>&#8220;Weary.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nellie Hazelton did not see this letter, though Hollis told her that Ed had
been operated on and that he was doing as well as could be expected. And the
telegraph that night flashed Weary&#8217;s &#8220;coin&#8221; to him.</p>

<p>The days passed all too quickly now, for the time for the fall round-up was
at hand and Hollis realized with regret that his daily rides&#8211;with Nellie
Hazelton as a companion&#8211;must soon be discontinued.</p>

<p>The nights had already grown cool; snow had appeared on the mountain peaks;
the basin was no longer a great green bowl, but resembled a mammoth, concave
palette upon which nature had mixed her colors&#8211;yellow and gold and brown,
with here and there a blotch of red and purple, a dash of green,&#8211;lingering
over the season&#8211;and great, wide stretches of gray. The <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338'></a>338</span> barren spots seemed to
grow more barren&#8211;mocked by the scarlet blossoms of the cactus that seemed
to be everlasting, and the fringing, yellow soap weed, hardy, defying the
advancing winter. Razor-Back ridge was a desolate place. Never attractive, it
reared aloft barren and somber, frowning down upon its fringe of shrubbery the
latter stripped of its leaves, its scant beauty gone and bending its bare
branches stubbornly to the early winds.</p>

<p>With the last day of the month came a rain&#8211;a cold, bitter, driving
storm that raged for three days and started a drift that the cattlemen could not
stop. Arrayed in tarpaulins the cowboys went forth, suffering, cursing, laboring
heroically to stem the tide. The cattle retreated steadily before the
storm&#8211;no human agency could halt them. On the second day Norton came into
the Circle Bar ranchhouse, wet, disgusted, but fighting mad.</p>

<p>&#8220;If this damn rain don&#8217;t stop pretty soon,&#8221; he told Hollis
as he dried himself before the open fireplace, &#8220;we&#8217;ll have cattle
down here from over the Colorado line. An&#8217; then there&#8217;ll be hell to
pay!&#8221;</p>

<p>But on the third day the rain ceased and the sun came out. The country lay
smiling in the sunshine, mellow, glistening, inviting. But the <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339'></a>339</span> damage had been wrought.
From Lemuel Train of the Pig Pen outfit, came word that fifty per cent of his
cattle were missing. Truxton of the Diamond Dot, Henningson of the Three Bar,
and nearly all of the other small owners, reported losses. Of course the cattle
would be recovered during the fall round up, but they were now scattered and
fair prey for cattle thieves, and with the round up still two weeks away it
seemed that many must be stolen.</p>

<p>Yet there was nothing that could be done; it is folly to attempt to
&#8220;cut out&#8221; cattle on the open range.</p>

<p>From the editorial columns of the <i>Kicker</i> might be gleaned the fact
that the Law had come into Union County. Many men of Dry Bottom entered the
<i>Kicker</i> office to thank Hollis; others boldly draped their houses with
flags and bunting.</p>

<p>Dunlavey had visited Dry Bottom twice since the incident of the primary. He
had said nothing concerning the incident to anyone save possibly his intimates,
but from the sneer that appeared on his face when approached by those whom he
considered friendly to Hollis it was plain that he intended continuing the
fight.</p>

<p>Hollis had been compelled to record in the <i>Kicker</i> the unpleasant news
that Dunlavey had <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340'></a>340</span>
refused to comply with the new law regulating brands and the submitting of lists
for taxation, and also that he had threatened to shoot the first officer
trespassed on his land. Dunlavey had not complied with the law, but he had
failed to carry out his threat to &#8220;shoot the first officer that trespassed
on his land,&#8221; for Allen had trespassed several times, openly and boldly.
Moreover, Dunlavey had seen him, had even spoken to him, but had offered no
violence.</p>

<p>Perhaps in a calmer mood Dunlavey had decided not to use his weapon; perhaps
there was something about the quiet, cool, and deliberate Allen which convinced
Dunlavey that the former might be able to give a good account of himself in the
event of trouble. At any rate several times Allen had ridden the Circle Cross
range unmolested by either Dunlavey or his men. He explored the farthest limits
of the Circle Cross property, tallying the cattle, nosing around the corrals,
examining brands, and doing sundry other things not calculated to allay
Dunlavey&#8217;s anger over this new and odd condition of affairs.</p>

<p>Then one day he failed to visit the Circle Cross. Instead, he appeared to
Potter in the office of the <i>Kicker</i> with copy for a poster announcing the
sale by auction of a thousand of Dunlavey&#8217;s best cattle. He ordered Potter
to print it so that he <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_341'></a>341</span> might post copies throughout the county within a
week. The night following the issue of the <i>Kicker</i> containing the
announcement concerning the coming of the law Potter had informed Hollis that he
had that day delivered the notices to Allen.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342'></a>342</span><a id='link_28'></a>CHAPTER XXVIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>IN DEFIANCE OF THE LAW</span></h2>

<p>Hollis had demonstrated the fact that a majority of Dry Bottom&#8217;s
citizens welcomed the law. Dry Bottom had had a law, to be sure&#8211;the law of
the six-shooter, with the cleverest man &#8220;on the trigger&#8221; as its
chief advocate. Few men cared to appear before such a court with an argument
against its jurisdiction. The law, as the citizens of Dry Bottom had seen it,
was an institution which frowned upon such argument. Few men cared to risk an
adverse decision of the established court to advocate laws which would come from
civilized authority; they had remained silent against the day when it would come
in spite of the element that had scoffed at it. And now that day had arrived.
The Law had come.</p>

<p>Even the evil element knew it. The atmosphere was vibrant with suppressed
excitement; in the stores men and women were congregated; in the saloons rose a
buzz of continuous conversation. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_343'></a>343</span> On the street men greeted one another with subdued
voices, or halted one another to discuss the phenomenon. In a dozen conspicuous
places were posted flaring, printed notices, informing the reader that a
thousand of the Circle Cross cattle&#8211;a description of which
followed&#8211;were, on the following day, to be sold to the highest bidder.
Below this announcement, in small, neat print, was quoted the Law.</p>

<p>Dry Bottom gasped. The saloons swarmed. In the Fashion two bartenders and the
proprietor labored heroically to supply their customers with the liquid
stimulant which would nerve them to look upon Ben Allen&#8217;s posters with a
certain degree of equanimity. The reckless element&#8211;the gun-men who in a
former day were wont to swagger forth with reckless disregard for the polite
conventions&#8211;skulked in the background, sneering at this thing which had
come to rob them of their power and which, they felt, presaged their ultimate
downfall.</p>

<p>But Dry Bottom ignored the gun-men, or smiled blandly at them, giving its
attention to Ben Allen&#8217;s posters and discussing a rumor which had gained
rapid credence, to the effect that the new governor had telegraphed Allen that
he would hold a detail of United States soldiers in readiness for any
contingency.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344'></a>344</span>The good
citizens smiled. And throughout the day many of them passed and repassed the
<i>Kicker</i> office, anxious to get a glimpse of the man who had been
instrumental in bringing about this innovation.</p>

<p>Shortly after noon on the same day Dunlavey rode into Dry Bottom, dismounted,
hitched his pony to the rail in front of the Fashion, and entered.</p>

<p>In former days Dunlavey&#8217;s appearance within the doors of the Fashion
was the signal for boisterous greetings. For here might always be found the
law&#8217;s chief advocates. To-day, however, there were no greetings. Minds
were filled with vague and picturesque conjecture concerning Dunlavey&#8217;s
probable actions and the outcome of this strange affair. Thus upon
Dunlavey&#8217;s entrance a silence&#8211;strange and awkward&#8211;fell in the
bar-room. There were short nods and men fell away from Dunlavey as he crossed
the room and came to a halt before one of Ben Allen&#8217;s posters. He read
every line of it&#8211;every word. No man interrupted him. Then, finishing his
reading, he turned and faced the crowd, his face white with wrath, his lips
snarling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why in hell didn&#8217;t some of you damned fools tear this
down?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>No man felt it incumbent upon him to reply to <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_345'></a>345</span> this and Dunlavey watched them for an
instant, sneering, his eyes glittering menacingly. Then he suddenly turned,
seized the poster, savagely tore it into pieces, hurled the pieces to the floor,
and stamped upon them. Then he turned again to the silent crowd, his face
inflamed, his voice snapping with a bitter, venomous sarcasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Scared!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Scared out clean&#8211;like a bunch of
coyotes runnin&#8217; from the daylight!&#8221; He made a strange sound with his
lips, expressing his unutterable contempt for men so weakly constituted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quit!&#8221; he grated. &#8220;Quit clean because a tenderfoot comes
out here and tries to run things! So long as things come your way you&#8217;re
willing to stick it out, but when things go the other way&#8211;Ugh!&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned abruptly, strode out through the door, mounted his pony, and rode
rapidly down the street. Several of the men, who went to the door after his
departure, saw him riding furiously toward the Circle Cross.</p>

<p>Then one of his former friends laughed harshly&#8211;sarcastically. &#8220;I
reckon that there tenderfoot is botherin&#8217; Big Bill a whole lot,&#8221; he
said as he turned to the bar.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>It had been a busy day for Hollis. His hand <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_346'></a>346</span> had been shaken so much that it pained him. The day
had been a rather warm one for the season and so when late in the afternoon
Norton rode into town, &#8220;To see the excitement,&#8221; he told Hollis, the
latter determined to make the return trip to the Circle Bar in the evening.
Therefore, after a short conference with Judge Graney and Allen&#8211;and a
frugal, though wholesome supper in the Judge&#8217;s rooms back of the court
house&#8211;which Allen cooked&#8211;he and Norton rode out upon the Coyote
trail and jogged quietly toward the Circle Bar.</p>

<p>There was a good moon; the air was invigorating, though slightly chill, and
the trail lay clear and distinct before them, hard after the rain, ideal for
riding.</p>

<p>Many times during the first half hour of the ride Norton looked furtively at
his chief. Certain things that Mrs. Norton had told him held a prominent place
in his thoughts, and mingling with these thoughts was the recollection of a
conversation that he had held with Hollis one day when both of them had been
riding this same trail and Hollis had stopped off at the Hazelton cabin. Many
times Norton smiled. He would have liked to refer to that conversation, but
hesitated for fear of seeming to meddle with that which did not concern him. He
remembered the days <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_347'></a>347</span> of his own courtship&#8211;how jealously he had
guarded his secret.</p>

<p>But the longer his thoughts dwelt upon the incident that had been related to
him by Mrs. Norton the harder it became to keep silent. But he managed to
repress his feelings for the first half hour and then, moved by an internal
mirth that simply would not be held in check longer, he cackled aloud.</p>

<p>He saw Hollis shoot a quick glance at him. He cackled again, his mirth
swelling as he caught the surprised and puzzled expression of Hollis&#8217;s
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a very original opinion of people who laugh without any visible
cause,&#8221; remarked the latter, grinning reluctantly in the
semi-darkness.</p>

<p>Norton&#8217;s reply was another cackle. They rode in silence for a long
time.</p>

<p>Then Norton spoke. &#8220;This is a great country,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Silence from Hollis, though taking a quick glance at him Norton again
observed the puzzled grin on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;And original,&#8221; he remarked, placing upon the latter word the
same peculiar emphasis that Hollis had given it a moment before.</p>

<p>Hollis grinned widely; he began to detect a subtle meaning in the range
boss&#8217;s speech and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_348'></a>348</span> actions. But he did not answer; it would not strain
his patience to await until such a time as Norton made his meaning clear.</p>

<p>&#8220;But there&#8217;s some things that ain&#8217;t original,&#8221;
continued Norton in the same tone, after another short silence.</p>

<p>This remark clearly required comment. Hollis grinned mildly. &#8220;Meaning
what?&#8221; he questioned.</p>

<p>Norton met his gaze gravely. &#8220;Meanin&#8217; that the ways of
makin&#8217; love are pretty much the same in every country.&#8221; He laughed.
&#8220;I know there&#8217;s different ways of makin&#8217; it&#8211;in
books,&#8221; he continued; &#8220;the folks which write books make their men
an&#8217; women go at it all kinds of ways. But did you ever know anyone in real
life to make love to a girl any different than anyone else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have had no experience in love making,&#8221; returned Hollis,
puzzled again.</p>

<p>Norton cackled. &#8220;No,&#8221; he said, &#8220;an&#8217; that&#8217;s the
peculiar part of it. Mostly no one has ever had any experience when they start
to makin&#8217; love the first time. But they all make it the same way.
That&#8217;s why it ain&#8217;t original. You take a man which has got in love
with a girl&#8211;any man. He don&#8217;t want anyone to know that he&#8217;s in
love with her&#8211;he feels sorta sheepish about it. <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_349'></a>349</span> Goes around hangin&#8217; his head
an&#8217; blushin&#8217;, an&#8217; mostly not sayin&#8217; anything about it.
Once he gets it into his system he ain&#8217;t the same man any more. Takes to
actin&#8217; reserved like an&#8217; gentle. But them that&#8217;s had
experience can see the symptoms. There ain&#8217;t no way to hide it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Had Norton looked at Hollis now he might have observed a touch of red in the
young man&#8217;s face. But he did not look; he was watching the trail ahead,
smiling broadly.</p>

<p>They had been riding through a deep depression, going toward a ridge whose
crest was fringed with dense, tangled shrubbery. Hollis was about to reply to
Norton&#8217;s remark when he saw the latter&#8217;s lips suddenly straighten;
saw his body stiffen as he drew himself erect in the saddle and pulled his pony
abruptly up. Surprised, Hollis also reined in and sat silent, looking at
Norton.</p>

<p>The latter&#8217;s hand went to one of his ears, the fingers spreading out,
fan like. &#8220;Listen!&#8221; he warned sharply.</p>

<p>Hollis had been listening. A low rumble greeted his ears. He looked suddenly
upward at the sky, fearful that another storm, such as he had encountered months
before, might be forming. But the sky was cloudless. He looked again at Norton.
The latter&#8217;s eyes shone brightly <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_350'></a>350</span> in the moonlight as he leaned toward Hollis. The
rumbling had grown more distinct.</p>

<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t a stampede,&#8221; said Norton rapidly; &#8220;there
wouldn&#8217;t be anything to stampede cattle on a night like this. An&#8217;
them&#8217;s cattle!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was about a hundred yards to the ridge toward which they had been riding
and Hollis saw Norton suddenly plunge the spurs into his pony&#8217;s flanks;
saw the animal rush forward. He gave his own animal the spurs and in an instant
was at Norton&#8217;s side, racing toward the ridge. The range boss dismounted
at the bottom, swiftly threw the reins over his pony&#8217;s head, and running
stealthily toward the crest. Hollis followed him. When he reached Norton&#8217;s
side the latter was flat on a rim rock at the edge of a little cliff, behind
some gnarled brush. Below them the country stretched away for miles, level,
unbroken, basking in the moonlight. Hollis recognized the section as that
through which he had traveled on the night he had been overtaken by the
storm&#8211;the big level that led to Big Elk crossing, where he had met
Dunlavey and his men that night.</p>

<p>Looking out upon the plain he held his breath in amazement. During the time
he had been at the Circle Bar he had seen cattle running, but never had he seen
them run like this. About a <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_351'></a>351</span> quarter of a mile from the ridge on which he and
Norton stood rose a dust cloud&#8211;moving swiftly. But ahead of the cloud,
heads down, their horns tossing were a number of cattle, perhaps fifty, racing
furiously. They were running parallel with the ridge and would probably pass it.
Behind and flanking them raced several cowboys, silent, driving with their
quirts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rustlers!&#8221; came Norton&#8217;s voice from beside him.
&#8220;They&#8217;re headin&#8217; for Big Elk!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis had brought his rifle, which he had carried since the attack on the
night of the storm. At Norton&#8217;s word he raised it. But Norton&#8217;s hand
touched his and his voice came again, sharply, commandingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t shoot!&#8221; he said. &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t do any
good; some of them would get away. Mebbe they&#8217;ll come close enough
so&#8217;s we can see who they are!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis waited breathlessly. It seemed that but an instant had passed from the
time he had caught a first glimpse of them until they were thundering by the
ridge and he and Norton were blinded by the dust. They had gone before the dust
settled, but through it as they passed, Hollis had caught sight of a familiar
figure. Before the thunder of hoofs had died away Hollis felt Norton&#8217;s
hand on his arm and his voice in his ear.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_352'></a>352</span>&#8220;Dunlavey!&#8221;</p>

<p>There could be no doubt of that, for Hollis had recognized him also. He
turned, to hear Norton&#8217;s dry voice in his ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;The new law don&#8217;t seem to be botherin&#8217; Dunlavey a
heap,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Hollis stepped boldly out on the ridge, his face grim and pale. But he was
pulled back by Norton. &#8220;I take it you don&#8217;t want to let them see
you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When a thing like that comes off there&#8217;s
always somebody sure to be lookin&#8217; back.&#8221; He was pulling at
Hollis&#8217;s arm, directing his steps down the slope toward where they had
left the horses. &#8220;You an&#8217; me ain&#8217;t enough,&#8221; he was
saying to Hollis; &#8220;we&#8217;ll hit the breeze to the Circle Bar, get some
of the boys, an&#8217; hustle back here an&#8217; take them cattle!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis accompanied him willingly as far as the horses. Then he halted, his
eyes flashing brightly. &#8220;We won&#8217;t go to the Circle Bar,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;We won&#8217;t fight them like that. There is a law in this country
now and I am going to see that the law acts!&#8221; He seized Norton&#8217;s arm
in a firm commanding grip. &#8220;You follow them,&#8221; he directed.
&#8220;From the edge of the butte where they caught me on the night of the storm
you can see the country for miles. Don&#8217;t cross the river,&#8221; he
warned. &#8220;Stay there beside <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_353'></a>353</span> the butte until I come back&#8211;I won&#8217;t be
long. Watch where they take the cattle!&#8221;</p>

<p>Before Norton could offer a word of objection he was on his pony and racing
over the back trail at terrific speed. For a moment Norton watched him. Then he
disappeared and Norton grimly mounted his pony and rode down to the level
following the trail taken by the thieves.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354'></a>354</span><a id='link_29'></a>CHAPTER XXIX<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE ARM OF THE LAW</span></h2>

<p>The lights in Dry Bottom&#8217;s saloons were flickering brightly when Hollis
rode down the street and dismounted from his drooping pony in front of the court
house. He ran stiffly around the side of the building and knocked loudly on a
door. There was a short silence and then a movement inside and Ben Allen stuck
his head out of a window. He saw at a glance the upward turned face of the
nocturnal visitor and called shortly: &#8220;Wait! I&#8217;ll be
down!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a short wait, during which Hollis impatiently paced back and forth
and then Allen appeared in the door, fully dressed. Judge Graney, in a night
shirt, stood behind him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something&#8217;s up, of course,&#8221; drawled Allen as he stepped
down from the door, &#8220;or you wouldn&#8217;t come around disturbing folks
this way. What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis briefly related the events of the night, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_355'></a>355</span> concluding with the statement that he
was determined to force the law to act.</p>

<p>&#8220;Correct!&#8221; laughed Allen. &#8220;She&#8217;s got to act
now.&#8221; He caught Hollis&#8217;s arm and turned him toward a small
cottonwood grove about half a mile distant. A dozen white objects dotting the
grove caught Hollis&#8217;s gaze. He started.</p>

<p>&#8220;Soldiers!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I might say that was a good guess,&#8221; drawled Allen. &#8220;I sent
for them because I thought I might need them if our friend Dunlavey got to
cuttin&#8217; up any. It&#8217;s been my experience that a detail of Uncle
Sam&#8217;s boys is about as good a thing to have around in case of trouble as
any man could want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you can&#8217;t use them in this case,&#8221; remarked Judge
Graney, who had stepped down beside the two men. &#8220;The governor&#8217;s
instructions were that they should be used merely as an instrument in enforcing
the court&#8217;s order regarding the sale of Dunlavey&#8217;s cattle. The theft
of the Circle Bar cattle is a matter which comes directly under the jurisdiction
of the sheriff. If he refuses to act&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hell!&#8221; broke in Allen. &#8220;We know he won&#8217;t do
anything!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Judge smiled slightly. &#8220;I suspect he won&#8217;t,&#8221; he said
dryly. He winked at Hollis.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_356'></a>356</span>&#8220;Being a
judge in this district I am, of course, averse to advising any infractions of
the law. But if I were not a judge I would suggest that two strong, energetic
men&#8211;such as you appear to be&#8213;&#8221; He leaned forward and whispered
in Allen&#8217;s ear, whereat that gentleman let out a joyous whoop and almost
dragged Hollis around the corner of the building toward the street, leaving the
Judge standing in the doorway.</p>

<p>Once on the street Allen set a pace that brought the two to the door of the
sheriff&#8217;s office quickly. A light shone through the window and when Allen
opened the door Watkins was sitting beside his desk, gravely fumbling a deck of
cards. He dropped them when he saw his visitors and made a quick movement with
his right hand toward his revolver. But Allen&#8217;s weapon was already
out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill,&#8221; he said in a soft, even voice, &#8220;we&#8217;re
wantin&#8217; a warrant for the arrest of Bill Dunlavey. The charge is
stealin&#8217; cattle. Of course you&#8217;ll issue it,&#8221; he added
insinuatingly.</p>

<p>Watkins&#8217;s face slowly paled. &#8220;Why&#8213;&#8221; he began.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I knowed you wouldn&#8217;t do it when I asked you,&#8221;
said Allen with a dangerously soft smile. &#8220;That&#8217;s why I come down
here. This town&#8217;s got a sheriff an&#8217; it ain&#8217;t. I wouldn&#8217;t
care <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357'></a>357</span> a damn if it
didn&#8217;t have you. There&#8217;s lots of folks wouldn&#8217;t care either.
So that if you&#8217;re one of them which does care you&#8217;re settin&#8217;
right still an&#8217; not sayin&#8217; anything which can be construed as talk
till my friend here goes down to the station.&#8221; He whispered to Hollis.
&#8220;Be middlin&#8217; rapid,&#8221; he said aloud afterward, &#8220;an&#8217;
use my name.&#8221; He turned to Watkins with a smile. &#8220;While we&#8217;re
waitin&#8217; I&#8217;ll do some talkin&#8217;,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But if
you let out one little wee chirp them folks which don&#8217;t care about you
bein&#8217; sheriff of this man&#8217;s town will sure have a heap of cause to
rejoice.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis was already far down the street toward the station. When he got there
the station was dark&#8211;evidently the agent had gone to bed. Hollis pounded
heavily on the door and presently the agent opened it, appearing in his night
shirt, a heavy six-shooter in hand, his eyes blinking.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Hollis,&#8221; said the latter from the darkness; &#8220;I
want you to telegraph the governor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in.&#8221; The agent disappeared within, Hollis following.
&#8220;This way,&#8221; he directed, as he disappeared through another door
leading into the station, his night shirt flapping about his lean legs.
&#8220;What you wantin&#8217; to telegraph?&#8221; he questioned, as he seated
himself before the instrument <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_358'></a>358</span> and looked up at Hollis. And then, before the
latter could answer he continued: &#8220;You&#8217;re the durndest man to stir
up a muss I ever, seen in my life!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis smiled grimly as he seized a blank and wrote his message to the
governor:</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p>&#8220;Cattle thieves caught red-handed. Sheriff refuses to act. Crisis.
Suggest you appoint me temporarily.</p>
</div><!-- block quote -->

<p class='tar2'>Ben Allen.&#8221;</p>

<p>The agent took the message, read it, and then monotonously began to drum on
the keys of his instrument.</p>

<p>Hollis found it impossible to sit still and so he nervously paced up and down
the room during the sending of the message. The agent finished and, leaned his
head sleepily on the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ought to answer in half an hour&#8211;if he&#8217;s home,&#8221; he
informed Hollis. Upon which Hollis slipped out of the door and returned down the
street to the sheriff&#8217;s office, peering within Watkins still sat at the
table and in a chair near him lounged Allen, talking volubly. Hollis watched for
a time and then returned to the station to find the agent asleep beside his
instrument. Hollis had scarcely awakened him when the sounder began its
monotonous ticking. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_359'></a>359</span> He leaned over the agent&#8217;s shoulder and read
the governor&#8217;s answer as the agent sleepily wrote it down.</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p>&#8220;Ben Allen: You are hereby appointed sheriff of Union County in place
of W. Watkins, dismissed. Have Judge certify,&#8221;</p> </div><!-- block quote
-->

<p>&#8220;I reckon there must be somethin&#8217; goin&#8217; on,&#8221; remarked
the agent. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with Bill&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>But Hollis had snatched the message from his hand and was out into the street
in an instant and running down toward the sheriff&#8217;s office. When he
arrived there Allen was still talking. He passed the telegram to him and the
latter rose to his feet and smiled at Watkins, shoving the message under his
nose.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can read her,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Then you can go home
an&#8217; quit sheriffin&#8217;&#8211;after I&#8217;ve got through with you.
You&#8217;ve been called down to the court house. I&#8217;m takin&#8217; you,
chargin&#8217; you with bein&#8217; an accessory before the fact, or
somethin&#8217; like that. It don&#8217;t make no difference what it is,
you&#8217;re goin&#8217; with me.&#8221; His voice came sharp and chill:
&#8220;Jump!&#8221;</p>

<p>Judge Graney had dressed himself by the time the three arrived at the court
house and Watkins was roughly tumbled into the room which had <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_360'></a>360</span> been set aside as the
jail. Then the judge led Hollis and Allen into the court room where he issued
Allen&#8217;s certificate of appointment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, I reckon we won&#8217;t have no trouble in gettin&#8217; the
soldiers,&#8221; he grinned. &#8220;This sheriff is goin&#8217; to
act!&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_361'></a>361</span><a id='link_30'></a>CHAPTER XXX<br /><span class='h2fs'>FORMING A FRIENDSHIP</span></h2>

<p>At three o&#8217;clock in the afternoon Hollis closed his desk and announced
to Potter that he was going to the Circle Bar. Potter watched him with a fond
smile as he went out the door and placed the saddle on his pony, mounted and
rode into the sunshine of the afternoon. The presence of the troopers in town
had created a sensation and most of the town&#8217;s citizens were gathered
about the court house, curiously watching Dunlavey and several of his men who
had been taken into custody during the early hours of the morning. Neither
Hollis or Norton had been allowed to participate in the final scene, the little
captain informing them curtly that the presence of civilians at what promised to
be a free-for-all fight was strictly forbidden. And so Norton had returned to
the Circle Bar, while Hollis had gone to Dry Bottom to finish an article for the
next issue of the <i>Kicker</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_362'></a>362</span>It had been in
that bald, gray time between darkness and dawn when Ben Allen and Hollis, riding
at the head of the detail of troopers beside the dapper little captain, had
arrived at the edge of the butte where Hollis had directed Norton to await his
coming.</p>

<p>Norton&#8217;s only comment upon seeing the troopers had been: &#8220;Where
in hell did them come from?&#8221;</p>

<p>He told Allen that he had watched where Dunlavey and his men had driven the
cattle, and that he would find them concealed in a narrow defile between two
hills about a mile on the other side of the Rabbit-Ear. He and Hollis had
announced their intention to accompany the troop to the scene, but had been
refused permission by the captain.</p>

<p>The capture of the thieves had been quite a simple matter. In single file the
troopers had descended the slope of the river, crossed a shallow, and clattered
up the other side. A mile dash at a gallop had brought them to one end of the
defile mentioned by Norton, and in a grove of fir-balsam the captain had
deployed his troopers and swooped suddenly down into the defile, surprising
several men, who with Dunlavey, were busily at work altering the brands on the
cattle they had stolen. There was a fire near the <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_363'></a>363</span> center of the defile, with branding
irons scattered about it.</p>

<p>The stolen cattle bore various brands. There were perhaps a dozen belonging
to the Circle Bar, several from the Pig Pen; others bore the brands of the Three
Bar and the Diamond Dot.</p>

<p>Proof of Dunlavey&#8217;s guilt had been absolute. He had made some
resistance, but had been quickly overpowered by Allen and the troopers. Then
with their prisoners the troops had returned to Dry Bottom.</p>

<p>Hollis rode slowly toward the Circle Bar. He was tired&#8211;dead tired. When
he arrived at the Hazelton cabin the shade on the porch looked so inviting that
he dismounted, tied his pony to one of the slender porch columns, and seated
himself, leaning wearily against the column to which he had tied his pony.</p>

<p>He sat there long, staring at a clump of nondescript weed that fringed the
edge of the arroyo near the cabin, his thoughts filled with pictures of
incidents that had occurred to him during his stay in the West. Nellie Hazelton
appeared in every one of these pictures and therefore he smiled often.</p>

<p>He had not liked the country when he had first come here; it had seemed to
offer him no field for the pursuit of his ambition. Certainly the raising <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_364'></a>364</span> of cattle had never
entered into his scheme of things. Yet he now realized that there was plenty of
room in this country for success in this particular industry; all a man had to
do was to keep up his end until the law came. And now the law had come and he
had been partly responsible for its coming. The realization of this moved his
lips into a grim smile.</p>

<p>He filled and lighted his pipe, smoking placidly as he leaned against the
slender column, his gaze shifting to a clump of dense shrubbery that skirted the
trail within twenty feet of the cabin. He sat quiet, his long legs stretched out
to enjoy the warmth of the sun that struck a corner of the porch floor. His pipe
spluttered in depletion and he raised himself and looked around for his pony,
observing that the animal was contentedly browsing the tops of some weeds at the
edge of the porch. Then, resigning himself to the sensation of languor that
oppressed him, he knocked the ash from the pipe, filled it again, lighted it,
and resumed his former reclining position.</p>

<p>During the past few days he had given much thought to Dunlavey. He was
thinking of the man now, as his gaze went again to the clump of shrubbery that
skirted the trail.</p>

<p>Some men&#8217;s mental processes were incomprehensible. <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_365'></a>365</span> Dunlavey was one of these men. What did
the man hope to gain by defying the law? Would there not be profit enough in the
cattle business when conducted honestly?</p>

<p>He felt a certain contempt for the man, but mingled with it was a sort of
grim pity. No doubt Dunlavey felt justified in his actions, for he had lived
here a good many years, no doubt suffering the privations encountered by all
pioneers; living a hard life, dealing heavy blows to his enemies, and receiving
some himself. No doubt his philosophy of life had been of the peculiar sort
practiced by the feudal barons of the Old World, before civilization had come,
carrying its banner of justice, which, summed up epigrammatically, though
ironically, had been &#8220;Might is Right.&#8221; But might could never be
right in this country. Dunlavey must learn this lesson; he could not hope
to&#8211;!</p>

<p>Hollis sat suddenly erect, putting aside his pipe and his ruminations at the
same instant, the languor gone from him, his eyes narrowing coldly.</p>

<p>For suddenly, from behind the shrubbery that skirted the edge of the trail,
had appeared the man about whom he had been thinking! It was evident that he had
not come upon Hollis unexpectedly. He reined in his pony and sat motionless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_366'></a>366</span> in the saddle, his
face white, his eyes alight with passion.</p>

<p>For an instant neither man spoke. Hollis realized that the great moment for
which he had waited many days had arrived. And it had arrived unexpectedly. It
had arrived to find him tired after his activities of the night and in no
condition for a fight. He drew a deep breath and got to his feet, a grim smile
on his face. He stepped off the porch and stood by one of the columns, watching
Dunlavey closely. As he watched the grim smile on his face slowly faded, his
lips curled bitterly, his eyes chilled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;ve come to collect that thrashing?&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>Dunlavey dismounted quickly, his right hand flew to his holster, drawing his
revolver. He came toward Hollis crouching, a cold, merciless glitter in his
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you tenderfoot &#8213; &#8213;.&#8221; he snarled.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>From the moment of Hollis&#8217;s arrival at the court house the night before
Ben Allen had been constantly in action. It was late in the morning when he had
returned to the court house with his prisoners. The men who had been captured
with Dunlavey were still with the troopers, there not being sufficient room at
the court house for <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_367'></a>367</span> them. Watkins had been released and Dunlavey had
taken his place in the little room that answered for a jail. Shortly before noon
Allen proceeded to the station, where he telegraphed to the governor the story
of the capture. He had then deputized a dozen punchers and sent them to the
Circle Cross to round up a thousand of Dunlavey&#8217;s cattle and hold them
until the late afternoon when, according to Allen&#8217;s published program,
they were to be sold to the highest bidder. Then, tired and hungry, Allen sought
the Alhambra and ate a hearty meal.</p>

<p>Dry Bottom was swarming with visitors that had come in for the sale. But by
the time Allen had finished eating the exodus had begun. The trail leading to
the Circle Cross ranch was dotted with probable bidders, curiosity seekers,
idlers, and mere residents of the town. Now that the law had come there were
many who discovered that their sympathies had always been with the men who had
championed it. Allen found his way to the court house strewn with men who halted
him to express their good will. Many people gathered in front of the
<i>Kicker</i> office, eager for a glimpse of Hollis. Those who gathered there
before twelve-thirty saw him seated at his desk, tall, angular, serious of face,
absolutely unaffected by this thing which had caused a sensation. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_368'></a>368</span> Passing the
<i>Kicker</i> office on his way to the court house, Allen had paused to look
within and shout a greeting to him. Then he had continued on his way.</p>

<p>Arriving at the court house Allen looked in at Dunlavey to find him lying on
the floor, apparently asleep. Allen did not disturb him. He went out, threw the
saddle on his pony, and rode over to the grove where the soldiers were
quartered, talking long with the captain. At two o&#8217;clock he returned to
the court house to be greeted with the news that Dunlavey had escaped. Allen did
not stop to inquire how the escape had been accomplished. He remounted his pony
and raced down to the <i>Kicker</i> office, fearing that Dunlavey had gone
there. Potter informed him that his chief had departed for the Circle Bar fully
an hour and a half before. He had taken the Coyote trail&#8211;Potter had
watched him.</p>

<p>Allen wheeled his pony and returned to the court house. He was met at the
door by Judge Graney. The latter&#8217;s face was white and drawn with fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s gone to kill Hollis!&#8221; the judge told him through
white, set lips. &#8220;I heard him threaten Hollis this morning and a moment
ago a man told me that he had seen Dunlavey, not <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_369'></a>369</span> over half an hour ago, riding out the
Coyote trail at a dead run!&#8221;</p>

<p>Allen&#8217;s own face whitened. He did not stop to answer but drove the
spurs deep into his pony&#8217;s flanks and rode furiously down the street
toward a point near the <i>Kicker</i> office where he struck the trail.</p>

<p>The distance to the Circle Bar ranch was ten miles and Dunlavey had a good
half hour&#8217;s start! He fairly lifted his pony over the first mile, though
realizing that he could not hope to arrive at the Circle Bar in time to prevent
Dunlavey from carrying out his design to kill Hollis. No, he told himself as he
rode, he could not prevent him from killing Hollis, should he catch the latter
unprepared, but he promised himself that Dunlavey should not escape punishment
for the deed.</p>

<p>He had had some hope that Dunlavey would accept his defeat philosophically.
The latter was not the only man he had seen who had been defeated by the law.
Over in Colfax County and up in Wyoming he had dealt with many such men, and
usually, after they had seen that the law was inevitable, they had resigned
themselves to the new condition and had become pretty fair citizens. He had
imagined that Dunlavey would prove to be no exception, that after the <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_370'></a>370</span> first sting of defeat
had been removed he would meet his adversaries half way in an effort to patch up
their differences. The danger was in the time immediately following the
realization of defeat. A man of the Dunlavey type was then usually
desperate.</p>

<p>So Allen communed with himself as he rode at a head-long pace down the Coyote
trail, risking his neck a dozen times. Not once since he had left Dry Bottom had
he considered his own danger.</p>

<p>He had been riding more than half an hour, and was coming up out of a little
gully when he came upon a riderless pony, and close by it, browsing near a clump
of shrubbery, another. He recognized one of them instantly as Dunlavey&#8217;s,
and his teeth came together with a snap. He rode closer to the other pony,
examining it. On one of its hips was a brand&#8211;the Circle Bar. Allen&#8217;s
face whitened again. He had arrived too late. But he would not be too late to
wreak vengeance upon Dunlavey.</p>

<p>He dismounted and cautiously approached the brush at the side of the trail.
Parting it, he saw the roof of a cabin. He recognized it; he had passed it a
number of times during his exploration of the country. He drew back and crept
crept farther along in the brush, certain that he <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_371'></a>371</span> would presently see Dunlavey. But he
had not gone very far when he heard voices and he cautiously parted the brush
again and peered through.</p>

<p>He started back in surprise, an incredulous grin slowly appearing on his
face. The incredulity changed to amusement a moment later&#8211;when he heard
Hollis&#8217;s voice!</p>

<p>The young man was seated on the edge of the porch&#8211;smoking a pipe! Near
him, seated on a flat rock, his face horribly puffed out, with several ugly
gashes disfiguring it, his eyes blackened, his clothing in tatters, one hand
hanging limply by his side, the fingers crushed and bleeding, was Dunlavey! Near
him, almost buried in the sand, was a revolver. Allen&#8217;s smile broadened
when he saw Dunlavey&#8217;s empty holster. Evidently he had met with a
surprise!</p>

<p>While taking in these details Allen had not forgotten to listen to Hollis as
the latter talked to Dunlavey. Apparently Hollis had about finished his talk,
for his voice was singularly soft and even, and Dunlavey&#8217;s almost comical
air of dejection could not have settled over him in an instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;... and so of course I had to thrash you&#8211;you had it coming to
you. You haven&#8217;t been a man&#8211;you&#8217;ve acted like a sneak and a
cur all <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_372'></a>372</span> through
this business. You made a thrashing inevitable when you set Yuma on Nellie
Hazelton. You&#8217;ll have plenty of marks to remind you of the one you gave me
that night.&#8221; He pointed to his cheek. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got even for that.
But I think I wouldn&#8217;t have trimmed you quite so bad if you hadn&#8217;t
tried to shoot me a few minutes ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>He puffed silently at his pipe for a short time, during which Dunlavey sat on
the rock and squinted pathetically at him. Then he resumed:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard people talk of damned fools, but never, until I met
you, have I been unfortunate enough to come into personal contact with one. I
should think that when you saw the soldiers had come you would have surrendered
decently. Perhaps you know by now that you can&#8217;t fight the United States
Army&#8211;and that you can&#8217;t whip me. If you&#8217;ve got any sense left
at all you&#8217;ll quit fighting now and try your best to be a good
citizen.&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled grimly as he rose from the porch and walked to where Dunlavey sat,
standing over him and looking down at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dunlavey,&#8221; he said, extending his right hand to the beaten man,
&#8220;let&#8217;s call it quits. You&#8217;ve been terribly worked up, but you
ought to be over it now. You ought to be able to see <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_373'></a>373</span> that it doesn&#8217;t go. I&#8217;ve
thrashed you pretty badly, but you and your men used me up pretty well that
night and so it&#8217;s an even thing. Let&#8217;s shake and be friends. If you
show signs of wanting to be a man again I&#8217;ll withdraw the charge of
cattle stealing which I have placed against you, and I imagine I won&#8217;t
have any trouble in inducing Allen to call off that auction sale and accept
settlement of the claim against you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Until now Dunlavey had avoided looking at the outstretched hand. But now he
looked at it, took it and held it for an instant, his bruised and swollen face
taking on an expression of lugubrious self-pity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon I&#8217;ve got it in the neck all around,&#8221; he said
finally. &#8220;But I ain&#8217;t no squealer and I&#8217;ve got&#8213;&#8221;
His gaze met Hollis&#8217;s and his eyes gleamed with a reluctant admiration.
&#8220;By God, you&#8217;re white! I reckon you could have tore the rest of me
apart like you did my hand.&#8221; He held up the injured member for
inspection.</p>

<p>Allen&#8217;s grin could grow no broader, and now he showed his increased
satisfaction with a subdued cackle. He backed stealthily out of the shrubbery,
taking a final glance at the two men. He saw Hollis leading Dunlavey toward a
small water hole at the rear of the cabin; saw him bathing <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_374'></a>374</span> Dunlavey&#8217;s injured hand and
binding it with his handkerchief.</p>

<p>Then Allen proceeded to his pony, mounted, and departed for the court house
to tell Judge Graney the news that kept his own face continually in a smile.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_375'></a>375</span><a id='link_31'></a>CHAPTER XXXI<br /><span class='h2fs'>AFTERWARD</span></h2>

<p>From Razor-Back ridge the big basin spread away to the Blue Peak mountains.
On the opposite side of the ridge began the big plain on which, snuggled behind
some cottonwood trees, were the Circle Cross buildings. From where Hollis and
Nellie Hazelton sat on the ridge they could look miles down the Coyote trail,
into Devil&#8217;s Hollow; could see the two big cottonwood trees that stood
beside Big Elk crossing, above which, on the night of the storm, Hollis had been
attacked by Dunlavey&#8217;s men. Back on the stretch of plain above the basin
they could make out the Circle Bar buildings, lying close to the banks of the
river.</p>

<p>It was in the late afternoon and the sun had gone down behind the Blue Peaks,
though its last rays were just touching the crest of the ridge near Hollis and
Nellie. He had called her attention to the sinking sun, telling her that it was
time they started for the Circle Bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; she said; &#8220;someone is coming up the <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_376'></a>376</span> Coyote trail. I have
been watching him for ten minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollis faced the trail and watched also. In a quarter of an hour the horseman
came out of Devil&#8217;s Hollow. Hollis and Nellie could see him plainly as he
guided his pony around the huge boulders that filled the place. Hollis smiled
whimsically.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the poet,&#8221; he told Nellie, catching her gaze and
grinning widely at her. &#8220;I sent him to Dry Bottom this noon for the
mail&#8211;Potter is going to stay in town over night.&#8221;</p>

<p>For an instant it seemed that Ace would not see them, and Hollis rose from
the rock on which he had been sitting and halloed to him. He responded with a
shout and urged his pony up the steep side of the slope and then along the crest
until he came within a few feet of where they sat. He dismounted and came
forward, grinning broadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Takin&#8217; the view?&#8221; he questioned. His eyes twinkled.
&#8220;Sometimes there&#8217;s a heap of poetry could be got out of this county.
But&#8211;&#8221; and his eyelashes flickered slightly&#8211;&#8220;a
fellow&#8217;s got to be in the right frame of mind to get it out. I reckon you
two&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you got the mail?&#8221; interrupted Hollis, grimacing at
him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_377'></a>377</span>&#8220;I sure
did,&#8221; returned the poet, &#8220;one letter. I reckon the
blacksmith&#8217;ll be kickin&#8217; because I&#8217;ve been galivantin&#8217;
around the country for one letter. Here it is.&#8221; He passed an envelope to
Hollis, and the latter, with a quick glance at the legend in the upper left hand
corner, tore it open and read. It was from Weary.</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p>Dear boss i got cleaned out agin what did you send me a hundred dollars for

-->

<p class='tar2'>Weary</p>

<p>After reading the letter Hollis passed it over to Nellie, watching her, his
eyes alight with satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Oh!&#8221; The letter dropped from her
hand, was caught by the breezes and swirled several feet distant. Ace sprang to
recover it. When he turned, the letter in hand, he <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_378'></a>378</span> saw something that brought a huge grin
of sympathy to his face. But mingled with the sympathy was another emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boss,&#8221; he said, as Hollis, disengaging himself, turned and faced
him, &#8220;I&#8217;ve writ quite a nice little thing on &#8216;Love.&#8217; Mebbe
you&#8217;d like to&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>He caught Hollis&#8217;s frown and immediately retreated to his pony, his
grin broadening as he went. He cackled with mirth as Hollis&#8217;s voice
reached him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ace,&#8221; he said gravely, &#8220;don&#8217;t attempt to write a
poem on &#8216;Love&#8217; until you&#8217;ve had some experience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You havin&#8217; yours now?&#8221; insinuated Ace, as he mounted his
pony.</p>

<p>He alone caught Hollis&#8217;s reply. It was an expressive wink.</p>

<p class='finis'>THE END</p>
